<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The Gaelic Literature of Ireland is vast in extent and rich
in quality. The inedited manuscript materials, if published,
would occupy several hundred large volumes. Of
this mass only a small portion has as yet been explored by
scholars. Nevertheless three saga-cycles stand out from
the rest, distinguished for their compass, age and literary
worth, those, namely, of the gods, of the demigod Cuchulain,
and of Finn son of Cumhall. The Cuchulain cycle, also
called the Ulster cycle&mdash;from the home of its hero in the
North of Ireland&mdash;forms the core of this great mass of epic
material. It is also known as the cycle of Conchobar, the
king round whom the Ulster warriors mustered, and,
finally, it has been called the Red Branch Cycle from the
name of the banqueting hall at Emain Macha in Ulster.</p>

<p>Only a few of the hundred or more tales which once
belonged to this cycle have survived. There are some
dozen in particular, technically known as <i>Remsc&eacute;la</i> or
&quot;Foretales,&quot; because they lead up to and explain the great
T&aacute;in, the T&aacute;in B&oacute; C&uacute;alnge, &quot;The Cualnge Cattle-raid,&quot;
the Iliad of Ireland, as it has been called, the queen of Irish
epic tales, and the wildest and most fascinating saga-tale,
not only of the entire Celtic world, but even of all
western Europe.</p>

<p>The mediaeval Irish scholars catalogued their native
literature under several heads, probably as an aid to the
memory of the professional poets or story-tellers whose
stock-in-trade it was, and to one of these divisions they
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xii" name="Page_xii" title="xii">xii</a>
gave the name <i>T&aacute;inte</i>, plural of <i>T&aacute;in</i>. By this term, which
is most often followed by the genitive plural <i>b&oacute;</i>, &quot;cows,&quot;
they meant &quot;a driving,&quot; or &quot;a reaving,&quot; or even &quot;a drove&quot;
or &quot;herd&quot; of cattle. It is only by extension of meaning
that this title is applied to the T&aacute;in B&oacute; C&uacute;alnge, the most
famous representative of the class, for it is not, strictly
speaking, with the driving of cattle that it deals but with
that of the Brown Bull of Cualnge. But, since to carry
off the bull implies the carrying off of the herd of which
he was the head, and as the &quot;Brown&quot; is always represented
as accompanied by his fifty heifers, there were sufficient
grounds for putting the Brown Bull Quest in the
class of Cow-spoils.</p>

<p>The prominence accorded to this class of stories in the
early literature of Ireland is not to be wondered at when
the economic situation of the country and the stage
of civilization of which they are the faithful mirror is
borne in mind.<a name="footnotetag1_xii" id="footnotetag1_xii" href="#footnote1_xii"><sup>1</sup></a> Since all wars are waged for gain, and
since among the Irish, who are still very much a nation of
cattle raisers, cattle was the chief article of wealth and
measure of value,<a name="footnotetag2_xii" id="footnotetag2_xii" href="#footnote2_xii"><sup>2</sup></a> so marauding expeditions from one
district into another for cattle must have been of frequent
occurrence, just as among the North American Indians tribal
wars used to be waged for the acquisition of horses. That
this had been a common practice among their kinsmen on
the Continent also we learn from Caesar's account of the
Germans (and Celts?) who, he says, practised warfare not
only for a means of subsistence but also for exercising their
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii" name="Page_xiii" title="xiii">xiii</a>
warriors. How long-lived the custom has been amongst the
Gaelic Celts, as an occupation or as a pastime, is evident
not only from the plundering incursions or &quot;creaghs&quot;<a name="footnotetag3_xiii" id="footnotetag3_xiii" href="#footnote3_xiii"><sup>3</sup></a>
as they are called in the Highlands and described by Scott
in <i>Waverley</i> and <i>The Fair Maid of Perth</i>, but also
from the &quot;cattle-drives&quot; which have been resorted to in
our own day in Ireland, though these latter had a different
motive than plunder. As has been observed by Sir Henry
Sumner Maine, Lord Macaulay was mistaken in ascribing
this custom to &quot;some native vice of Irish character,&quot; for,
as every student of ancient Ireland may perceive, it is
rather to be regarded as &quot;a survival, an ancient and
inveterate habit&quot; of the race.</p>

<p>One of these many Cattle-preys was the T&aacute;in B&oacute;
C&uacute;alnge,<a name="footnotetag4_xiii" id="footnotetag4_xiii" href="#footnote4_xiii"><sup>4</sup></a> which, there can be little doubt, had behind it
no mere myth but some kernel of actual fact. Its historical
basis is that a Connacht chieftain and his lady went
to war with Ulster about a drove of cattle. The importance
of a racial struggle between the north-east province
and the remaining four grand provinces of Ireland cannot
be ascribed to it. There is, it is true, strong evidence to
show that two chief centres, political, if not cultural and
national, existed at the time of the T&aacute;in in Ireland, Cruachan
Ai, near the present Rathcroghan in Connacht, and Emain
Macha, the Navan Fort, two miles west of Armagh in
Ulster, and it is with the friendly or hostile relations of these
two that the Ultonian cycle of tales deals. Ulster, or, more
precisely, the eastern portion of the Province, was the scene
of all the Cattle-raids, and there is a degree of truth in the
couplet,&mdash;</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv" name="Page_xiv" title="xiv">xiv</a>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div>&quot;Leinster for breeding, And Ulster for reaving;</div>
<div>Munster for reading, And Connacht for thieving.&quot;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But there are no indications of a racial clash or war of
tribes. With the exception of the Oghamic writings inscribed
on the pillar-stones by Cuchulain, which seem to require
interpretation to the men of Connacht by Ulstermen, the
description of the warriors mustered by the Connacht
warrior queen and those gathered round King Conchobar
of Ulster accord quite closely.</p>

<p>The T&aacute;in B&oacute; C&uacute;alnge is the work not of any one man but
of a corporation of artists known as <i>filid</i>. The author of the
T&aacute;in in its present state, whoever he may have been, was
a strong partisan of Ulster and never misses an opportunity
of flattering the pride of her chieftains. Later a kind of
reaction against the pre-eminence given to Ulster and the
glorification of its hero sets in, and a group of stories arises
in which the war takes a different end and Cuchulain is
shown to disadvantage, finally to fall at the hands of a
Munster champion. It is to this southern province that
the saga-cycle which followed the Cuchulain at an interval
of two hundred years belongs, namely, the Fenian saga,&mdash;the
saga of Finn son of Cumhall, which still flourishes among
the Gaelic speakers of Ireland and Scotland, while the
Cuchulain stories have almost died out among them. The
mingling of the two sagas is the work of the eighteenth-century
Scots Lowlander, James Macpherson.</p>

<p>The T&aacute;in B&oacute; C&uacute;alnge is one of the most precious monuments
of the world's literature, both because of the poetic
worth it evidences at an early stage of civilization, and
for the light it throws on the life of the people among whom
it originated and that of their ancestors centuries earlier.
It is not less valuable and curious because it shows us the
earlier stages of an epic&mdash;an epic in the making&mdash;which
it does better perhaps than any other work in literature.
Ireland had at hand all the materials for a great national
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xv" name="Page_xv" title="xv">xv</a>
epic, a wealth of saga-material replete with interesting
episodes, picturesque and dramatic incidents and strongly
defined personages, yet she never found her Homer, a gifted
poet to embrace her entire literary wealth, to piece the disjointed
fragments together, smooth the asperities and hand
down to posterity the finished epic of the Celtic world,
superior, perhaps, to the Iliad or the Odyssey. What
has come down to us is &quot;a sort of patchwork epic,&quot; as
Prescott called the Ballads of the Cid, a popular epopee
in all its native roughness, wild phantasy and extravagance
of deed and description as it developed during successive
generations. It resembles the frame of some huge ship
left unfinished by the builders on the beach and covered
with shells and drift from the sea of Celtic tradition. From
the historical standpoint, however, and as a picture of the
old barbaric Celtic culture, and as a pure expression of
elemental passion, it is of more importance to have the
genuine tradition as it developed amongst the people, unvarnished
by poetic art and uninfluenced by the example
of older and alien societies.</p>

<p>According to the Chronicles of Ireland, as formulated
in the Annals of Tigernach,<a name="footnotetag5_xv" id="footnotetag5_xv" href="#footnote5_xv"><sup>5</sup></a> who died in 1088, King
Conchobar of Ulster began to reign in the year 30 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>,
and he is said to have died of grief at the news that
Christ had been crucified. His reign therefore lasted
about sixty years. Cuchulain died in the year 39 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>
in the twenty-seventh year of his age, as we learn from the
following entry: &quot;The death of Cuchulain, the bravest
hero of the Irish, by Lugaid son of Three Hounds, king of
Munster, and by Erc, king of Tara, son of Carbre Niafer,
and by the three sons of Calatin of Connacht. Seven
years was his age when he assumed arms, seventeen was
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi" name="Page_xvi" title="xvi">xvi</a>
his age when he followed the Driving of the Kine of Cualnge,
but twenty-seven years was his age when he died.&quot;<a name="footnotetag6_xvi" id="footnotetag6_xvi" href="#footnote6_xvi"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>A very different account is given in the manuscript known
as H. 3. 17, Trinity College, Dublin, quoted by O'Curry in
his <i>Manuscript Materials</i>, page 508. The passage concludes
with the statement: &quot;So that the year of the T&aacute;in
was the fifty-ninth year of Cuchulain's age, from the night
of his birth to the night of his death.&quot; The record first
quoted, however, is partly corroborated by the following
passage which I translate from the Book of Ballymote,
facsimil&eacute; edition, page 13, col. a, lines 9-21: &quot;In the
fourteenth year of the reign of Conair&egrave; (killed in 40 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>)
and of Conchobar, the Blessed Virgin was born. At
that time Cuchulain had completed thirteen years; and
in the fourth year after the birth of Mary, the expedition
of the Kine of Cualnge took place ... that is, in
the eighteenth year of the reign of Conair&egrave;. Cuchulain had
completed his seventeenth year at that time. That is, it was
in the thirty-second year of the reign of Octavius Augustus
that the same expedition took place. Eight years after
the T&aacute;in B&oacute; C&uacute;alnge, Christ was born, and Mary had completed
twelve years then, and that was in the fortieth year
of the reign of Octavius Augustus; and in the twenty-sixth
year of the reign of Conair&egrave; and Conchobar, and in
the second year after the birth of Christ, Cuchulain died.
And twenty-seven years was Cuchulain's age at that time.&quot;</p>

<p>These apparent synchronisms, of course, may only rest
upon the imagination of the Christian annalists of Ireland,
who hoped to exalt their ancient rulers and heroes by bringing
them into relation with and even making them participate
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii" name="Page_xvii" title="xvii">xvii</a>
in the events of the life of the Saviour. But in placing
the date of the expedition of the T&aacute;in at about the beginning
of the Christian era, Irish tradition is undoubtedly
correct, as appears from the character of the civilization
depicted in the Ulster tales, which corresponds in a remarkable
degree with what authors of antiquity have recorded
of the Celts and with the character of the age which archaeologists
call &quot;la T&egrave;ne,&quot; or &quot;Late Celtic,&quot; which terminates
at the beginning of the first century of our era. Oral
tradition was perhaps occupied for five hundred years
working over and developing the story of the T&aacute;in, and by
the close of the fifth century the saga to which it belonged
was substantially the one we have now. The text of the
tale must have been completed by the first half of the
seventh century, and, as we shall see, its oldest extant
version, the Book of the Dun, dates from about the year
1100.</p>

<p>But, whatever may be the precise dates of these events,
which we are not in a position to determine more accurately,
the composition of the T&aacute;in B&oacute; C&uacute;alnge antedates by a
considerable margin the epic tales of the Anglo-Saxons,
the Scandinavians, the Franks and the Germans. It is
the oldest epic tale of western Europe, and it and the cycle
of tales to which it belongs form &quot;the oldest existing
literature of any of the peoples to the north of the Alps.&quot;<a name="footnotetag7_xvii" id="footnotetag7_xvii" href="#footnote7_xvii"><sup>7</sup></a>
The deeds it recounts belong to the heroic age of Ireland
three hundred years before the introduction of Christianity
into the island, and its spirit never ceased to remain markedly
pagan. The mythology that permeates it is one of
the most primitive manifestations of the personification
of the natural forces which the Celts worshipped. Its
historical background, social organization, chivalry, mood
and thought and its heroic ideal are to a large extent, and
with perhaps some pre-Aryan survivals, not only those of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii" name="Page_xviii" title="xviii">xviii</a>
the insular Celts of two thousand years ago, but also of the
important and wide-spread Celtic race with whom Caesar
fought and who in an earlier period had sacked Rome and
made themselves feared even in Greece and Asia Minor.</p>

<p>The following is the Argument of the T&aacute;in B&oacute; C&uacute;alnge,
which, for the sake of convenience, is here divided into
sections:</p>


<h3><span class="sc">I. The Prologue</span></h3>

<p>One night at the palace of Cruachan in Connacht, a dispute
arose between Queen Medb, the sometime wife of
Conchobar, king of Ulster, and her consort Ailill, as to the
amount of their respective possessions. It may be remarked
in passing that in those days in Ireland, married
women retained their private fortune independent of their
husbands, as well as the dowry secured to them in marriage.
To procure the evidence of their wealth, the royal pair
sent messengers to assemble all their chattels which, on
comparison, were found to be equal, excepting only that
among Ailill's kine was a lordly bull called Finnbennach,
&quot;the Whitehorned,&quot; whose match was not to be found in
the herds of the queen.</p>


<h3><span class="sc">II. The Embassage to Dar&egrave; and the Occasion of the T&aacute;in</span></h3>

<p>As we might expect, Medb was chagrined at the discovery.
Now her herald macRoth had told her that
Dar&egrave; macFiachna, a landowner of Cualnge, a district in
the territory of her former husband, possessed an even
more wonderful bull than Ailill's, called Donn Cualnge,
&quot;the Brown Bull of Cualnge.&quot; So she despatched macRoth
to Dar&egrave; to pray for the loan of the bull.</p>

<p>Dar&egrave; received the queen's messengers hospitably and
readily granted her request, but in the course of the entertainment,
one of the messengers, deep in his cups, spoke
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xix" name="Page_xix" title="xix">xix</a>
against Dar&egrave;, and he, hearing this, withdrew his promise
and swore that he would never hand over the Brown Bull
of Cualnge.</p>


<h3><span class="sc">III. The Gathering of Medb's Forces</span></h3>

<p>The impetuous queen, enraged at the failure of her mission,
immediately mustered a formidable army, composed
not only of her Connachtmen but also of allies from all
parts of Ireland, wherewith to undertake the invasion of
Ulster. On her side were the Ulster chieftains who had
gone into exile into Connacht after the treacherous slaughter
of the sons of Usnech by King Conchobar of Ulster. Chief
among them was Fergus, who, moreover, had a personal
grievance against Conchobar. For, while Fergus was
king of Ulster, he had courted the widow Ness and, in order
to win her, promised to abdicate for the term of one year
in favour of her son Conchobar. But when the term had
elapsed, the youth refused to relinquish the throne, and
Fergus in anger entered the service of Medb of Connacht.
There he was loaded with favours, became the counsellor
of the realm and, as appears from more than one allusion
in the tale, the more than friend of the wife of King Ailill.</p>

<p>The four leagued provinces of Ireland being gathered
at Cruachan, the guidance of the host was entrusted to
Fergus, because he was acquainted with the province of
Ulster through which they were to march, and at the beginning
of winter&mdash;a point emphasized by the exponents of
the sun-theory&mdash;the mighty host, including in its ranks
the king and queen and some of the greatest warriors of
Ireland, with the princess Finnabair as a lure, set forth on
the raid into Ulster.</p>

<p>They crossed the Shannon near Athlone and, marching
through the province of Meath, arrived at the borders of
Cualnge. Fortunately for the invaders, the expedition
took place while the Ulstermen lay prostrate in their <i>cess</i>,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xx" name="Page_xx" title="xx">xx</a>
or &quot;Pains,&quot; a mysterious state of debility or torpor which
was inflicted on them periodically in consequence of an
ancient curse laid upon Conchobar and the warriors of
Ulster as a punishment for a wrong done to the goddess
Macha. This strange malady, resembling the <i>couvade</i>
among certain savage nations, ordinarily lasted five days
and four nights, but on this occasion the Ulstermen were
prostrate from the beginning of November till the beginning
of February. During all that time the burden of defending
the province fell on the shoulders of the youthful champion
Cuchulain, who had in his particular charge the plain of
Murthemne, the nearest district to Cualnge, the goal of the
expedition. For Cuchulain and his father Sualtaim were
alone exempt from the curse and the &quot;Pains&quot; which had
befallen the remainder of the champions of Ulster.</p>


<h3><span class="sc">IV. The Youthful Exploits of Cuchulain</span></h3>

<p>The Connacht host had not proceeded far when they
came upon evidence of some mighty force that opposed
them. In answer to the inquiries of Ailill and Medb,
Fergus explains that it is Cuchulain who disputes their further
advance, and, as evidence of the superhuman strength
and prowess of the Ulster youth, then in the seventeenth
year of his age, the Ulster exiles recount the mighty deeds
he had performed in his boyhood, chief among which is the
tale according to which, as eric for the killing of the hound
of Culann the Smith, the boy-hero Setanta assumed the
station and the name which ever after clung to him of
Cuchulain, &quot;the Hound of Culann.&quot;</p>


<h3><span class="sc">V. The Single Combats of Cuchulain</span></h3>

<p>Cuchulain agrees to allow the Connacht host to continue
their march on condition that every day they send one of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi" name="Page_xxi" title="xxi">xxi</a>
their champions to meet him in single combat. When he
shall have killed his opponent, the host shall halt and pitch
camp until the following morning. Medb agrees to abide
by these terms. In each of the contests which ensue, the
heroic youth is victorious and slays many of the most celebrated
warriors on the side of Connacht. The severest
of all these single combats was the one in which he had as
opponent his former friend and foster-brother Ferdiad.
At the end of a four days' battle, in which both adversaries
exhibited astounding deeds of valour, Ferdiad fell by the
hands of Cuchulain.</p>

<p>Impatient at these delays, Medb broke the sacred laws
of ancient Irish chivalry and led her army into Ulster,
overrunning the province, pillaging and burning as she
went, even up to the walls of Emain Macha, the residence
of Conchobar, and finally took possession of the Brown
Bull of Cualnge.</p>


<h3><span class="sc">VI. The Gathering of the Ulstermen and the Final Battle of the T&aacute;in</span></h3>

<p>By this time King Conchobar and his warriors have come
out of their debility and summoned their forces to an eminence
in Slane of Meath. The great gathering of the Ulstermen
is reported to Medb by her trusty herald macRoth,
and from his description of the leaders and their troops,
their exiled countryman Fergus designates them to the
nobles of Connacht. In the final battle Medb's army is
repulsed and retreats in flight into Connacht. Thus each
host has had its share of the fortunes of war: Medb has
laid waste the lands of her divorced husband and carried
off the Brown Bull of Cualnge, the prize of war, while on
the other hand, Conchobar has won the victory in the great
battle of Garech and Ilgarech.</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii" name="Page_xxii" title="xxii">xxii</a>


<h3><span class="sc">VII. The End of the two Bulls</span></h3>

<p>On the way back to Connacht, the Brown Bull of Cualnge
emitted such terrible bellowings that they reached the
ears of the Whitehorned remaining at home in his stall in
Cruachan, whence he rushed at full speed to attack the
other. A furious battle took place between the bulls, but
the Brown was the stronger, and raising his rival on his
horns he shook the Whitehorned into fragments over all
Ireland. He then returned in fury to Ulster, and in his
wild rage dashed his head against a rock and was killed.</p>

<p>The T&aacute;in B&oacute; C&uacute;alnge has been preserved, more or less
complete, in a score of manuscripts ranging in date from the
beginning of the twelfth to the middle of the nineteenth
century. There probably existed other manuscripts containing
not only the T&aacute;in as we have it but even episodes
now wanting <ins title="handwritten correction">in</ins> it. All of the extant manuscripts go back to
versions which date from the seventh century or earlier.
No manuscript of the T&aacute;in is wholly in the language of the
time when it was copied, but, under the cloak of the contemporaneous
orthography, contains forms and words so
obsolete that they were not understood by the copyist,
so that glossaries had to be compiled to explain them.</p>

<p>It is by a singular good fortune that this, the greatest
of all the epic tales of the Irish, has been handed down to
our day in the two most ancient and, for that reason, most
precious of the great Middle Irish collections of miscellaneous
contents known as the <i>Leabhar na hUidhre</i>, &quot;the
Book of The Dun (Cow),&quot; and the Book of Leinster. The
former and older of these vellum manuscripts (abbreviated
LU.) is kept in the Library of the Royal Irish Academy
at Dublin. It must have been written about the beginning
of the twelfth century, for its compiler and writer, Moelmuire
macCeilechair (Kelleher), is known to have been
slain at Clonmacnois in the year 1106; some of its linguistic
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii" name="Page_xxiii" title="xxiii">xxiii</a>
forms, however, are as old as the eighth century glosses.
Unfortunately, LU.'s account of the T&aacute;in is incomplete at
the beginning and the end, but the latter portion is made
good by the closely related, though independent, version
contained in the manuscript known as the Yellow Book
of Lecan (abbreviated YBL.). This manuscript was written
about the year 1391 and it is also kept in Dublin in the
Library of Trinity College. To the same group as LU.
and YBL., which for the sake of convenience we may call
version A, belong also the British Museum MSS., Egerton
1782, a large fragment, and Egerton 114, both dating from
the fifteenth or sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Version B comprises the closely related accounts of the
T&aacute;in as contained in the Book of Leinster (abbreviated LL.)
and the following MSS.: Stowe 984 (Royal Irish Academy),
written in the year 1633 and giving, except for the loss of
a leaf, a complete story of the T&aacute;in; H. 1. 13 (Trinity College,
Dublin), written in the year 1745 and giving the T&aacute;in
entire; Additional 18748 (abbreviated Add.), British
Museum, copied in the year 1800 from a 1730 original;
Egerton 209 and Egerton 106 (British Museum), both
fragments and dating from the eighteenth century. Fragments
of a modern version are also found in MS. LIX,
Advocates' Library, Edinburgh.</p>

<p>To version C belong only fragments: H. 2. 17 (Trinity
College, Dublin), dating from the end of the fourteenth
or the beginning of the fifteenth century; the almost
identical Egerton 93 (British Museum), consisting of only
ten leaves and dating from nearly a century later, and
H. 2. 12 (Trinity College, Dublin), consisting of only two
pages.<a name="footnotetag8_xxiii" id="footnotetag8_xxiii" href="#footnote8_xxiii"><sup>8</sup></a>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv" name="Page_xxiv" title="xxiv">xxiv</a></p>

<p>The manuscripts belonging to each of these versions,
A, B, and C, have sufficient traits in common to place them
in a group by themselves. The question of the relationship
of these manuscripts to one another and of the character
of the suppositional archetype from which they are all
descended is a most intricate one and one which has given
rise to considerable discussion. The question still awaits
a definite answer, which may never be forthcoming, because
of the disappearance not only of the first draft of the T&aacute;in,
but also of that of some <ins title="handwritten correction">of</ins> its later redactions. We must
not overlook the possibility, either, of an otherwise
faithful copyist having inserted in the text before him a
passage, or even an entire episode, of his own fabrication.
This, no doubt, happened not infrequently, especially in
the earlier period of the copying of Irish manuscripts, and
a single insertion of this kind, or the omission, intentionally
or by oversight, of a part of the original from the copy
might, it will easily be seen, lead one to conclude that there
once existed a form of the story which as a matter of fact
never existed.</p>

<p>The version of the T&aacute;in which I have chosen as the
basis for my translation is the one found in the Book of
Leinster (<i>Leabhar Laighneach</i>), a voluminous vellum manuscript
sometime called the Book of Glendalough and now
kept in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, catalogue
number H. 2. 18. Only a part of the original book remains.
It dates from about the year 1150. This date is established
by two entries in the manuscript itself: &quot;Aed son
of Crimthann (Hugh macGriffin) hath written this book
and out of many books hath he compiled it&quot; (facsimil&eacute;,
at the bottom of page 313). Who this Aed was will be
clear from the other entry. It appears that he had lent
the manuscript while still unfinished to Finn macGorman,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv" name="Page_xxv" title="xxv">xxv</a>
who was Bishop of Kildare from 1148 and died in the
year 1160, and who on returning the book wrote in it the
following laudatory note in Irish to Aed: &quot;(Life) and
health from Finn, the Bishop of Kildare, to Aed son of
Crimthann, tutor of the chief king (i.e. of King Dermod
macMurrogh, the infamous prince who half a century later
invited Strongbow and the Normans to come over from
Wales to Ireland) of Mug Nuadat's Half (i.e. of Leinster
and Munster), and successor of Colum son of Crimthann
(this Colum was abbot of Tir da ghlass the modern Terryglas
on the shore of Lough Derg, in the County Tipperary&mdash;and
died in the year 548), and chief historian of Leinster
in respect of wisdom and intelligence, and cultivation of
books, science and learning. And let the conclusion of
this little tale (i.e. the story of Ailill Aulom son of Mug
Nuadat, the beginning of which was contained in the book
which Finn returns) be written for me accurately by thee,
O cunning Aed, thou man of the sparkling intellect. May
it be long before we are without thee. My desire is that
thou shouldst always be with us. And let macLonan's
Songbook be given to me, that I may understand the
sense of the poems that are in it. <i>Et vale in Christo.</i>&quot;<a name="footnotetag9_xxv" id="footnotetag9_xxv" href="#footnote9_xxv"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>It would seem from another note in the manuscript<a name="footnotetag10_xxv" id="footnotetag10_xxv" href="#footnote10_xxv"><sup>10</sup></a>
that the Book of Leinster afterwards belonged to some admirer
of King Dermod, for he wrote: &quot;O Mary! Great
was the deed that was done in Ireland this day, the kalends
of August (1166)&mdash;Dermod, son of Donnoch macMurrogh,
King of Leinster and of the (Dublin) Danes to be banished
by the men of Ireland over the sea eastwards. Woe, woe
is me, O Lord, what shall I do!&quot;<a name="footnotetag11_xxv" id="footnotetag11_xxv" href="#footnote11_xxv"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi" name="Page_xxvi" title="xxvi">xxvi</a>

<p>My reason for founding the translation on the LL. version,
in spite of the fact that its composition is posterior by half
a century to that of LU., was not merely out of respect
for the injunction of the scribe of the <i>ne varietur</i> and to
merit his blessing (page 369), but also because LL.'s is the
oldest <i>complete</i> version of the T&aacute;in extant. Though as a
rule (and as is easily discernible from a comparison of LU.
and LL.), the shorter, terser and cruder the form of a tale
is, the more primitive it is, yet it is not always the oldest
preserved form of a work that represents the most ancient
form of the story. Indeed, it is not at all improbable that
LL. contains elements which represent a tradition antedating
the composition of LU. At all events, LL. has
these strong points in its favour, that, of all the versions,
it is the most uniform and consistent, the most artistically
arranged, the one with most colour and imagination, and
the one which lends itself most readily to translation, both
in itself and because of the convenient Irish text provided
by Professor Windisch's edition. In order to present the
T&aacute;in in its completest form, however, I have adopted the
novel plan of incorporating in the LL. account the translations
of what are known as conflate readings. These, as a
rule, I have taken from no manuscript that does not demonstrably
go back to a twelfth or earlier century redaction.
Some of these additions consist of but a single word: others
extend over several pages. This dovetailing could not always
be accomplished with perfect accuracy, but no variants
have been added that do not cohere with the context or
destroy the continuity of the story. Whatever slight inconsistencies
there may be in the accounts of single episodes,
they are outweighed, in my opinion, by the value and interest
of the additions. In all cases, however, the reader
can control the translation by means of the foot-notes which
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii" name="Page_xxvii" title="xxvii">xxvii</a>
indicate the sources and distinguish the accretions from the
basic text. The numerous passages in which Eg. 1782
agrees with LU. and YBL. have not all been marked. The
asterisk shows the beginning of each fresh page in the
lithographic facsimil&eacute; of LL., and the numbers following
&quot;W&quot; in the upper left hand margin show the corresponding
lines in the edition of the Irish text by Windisch.</p>

<hr />

<p>In general, I believe it should be the aim of a translator
to give a faithful rather than a literal version of his original.
But, owing to the fact that so little of Celtic scholarship
has filtered down even to the upper strata of the educated
public and to the additional fact that the subject matter
is so incongruous to English thought, the first object of
the translator from the Old Irish must continue to be, for
some time to come, rather exactness in rendering than
elegance, even at the risk of the translation appearing
laboured and puerile. This should not, however, be carried
to the extent of distorting his own idiom in order to imitate
the idiomatic turns and expressions of the original. In
this translation, I have endeavoured to keep as close to
the sense and the literary form of the original as possible,
but when there is conflict between the two desiderata, I
have not hesitated to give the first the preference. I have
also made use of a deliberately archaic English as, in my
opinion, harmonizing better with the subject. It means
much to the reader of the translation of an Old Irish text
to have the atmosphere of the original transferred as perfectly
as may be, and this end is attained by preserving its
archaisms and quaintness of phrase, its repetitions and
inherent crudities and even, without suppression or attenuation,
the grossness of speech of our less prudish ancestors,
which is also a mark of certain primitive habits of life but
which an over-fastidious translator through delicacy of
feeling might wish to omit. These side-lights on the semi-barbaric
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xxviii" name="Page_xxviii" title="xxviii">xxviii</a>
setting of the Old Irish sagas are of scarcely less
interest and value than the literature itself.</p>

<p>The T&aacute;in B&oacute; C&uacute;alnge, like most of the Irish saga-tales
as they have come down to us in their Middle Irish dress,
is chiefly in prose, but interspersed with verse. The verse-structure
is very intricate and is mostly in strophic form
composed of verses of fixed syllabic length, rhymed and
richly furnished with alliteration. There is a third form
of speech which is neither prose nor verse, but partakes
of the character of both, a sort of irregular, rhymeless verse,
without strophic division and exceedingly rich in alliteration,
internal rhyme and assonance. This kind of speech,
resembling in a way the dithyrambic passages in the Old
Testament, was known to the native Irish scholars as <i>rosc</i>
and it is usually marked in the manuscripts by the abbreviation
<i>R</i>. It was used in short, impetuous outbursts on
occasions of triumph or mourning.</p>

<p>While, on the whole, I believe the student will feel himself
safer with a prose translation of a poem than with one in
verse, it has seemed to me that a uniform translation of
the T&aacute;in B&oacute; C&uacute;alnge in prose would destroy one of its special
characteristics, which is that in it both prose and verse
are mingled. It was not in my power, however, to reproduce
at once closely and clearly the metrical schemes
and the rich musical quality of the Irish and at the same
time compress within the compass of the Irish measure
such an analytic language as English, which has to express
by means of auxiliaries what is accomplished in Early Irish
by inflection. But I hope to have accomplished the main
object of distinguishing the verse from the prose without
sacrifice of the thought by the simple device of turning the
verse-passages into lines of the same syllabic length as
those of the original&mdash;which is most often the normal
seven-syllable line&mdash;but without any attempt at imitating
the rhyme-system or alliteration.</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix" name="Page_xxix" title="xxix">xxix</a>

<p>In order not to swell the volume of the book, the notes
have been reduced to the indispensable minimum, reserving
the commentary and the apparatus of illustrative material
for another volume, which we hope some day to be able to
issue, wherein more definitely critical questions can be discussed.
There are a few Irish words which have been retained
in the translation and which require a word of explanation:
The Old Irish <i>geis</i> (later, also <i>geas</i><a name="footnotetag12_xxix" id="footnotetag12_xxix" href="#footnote12_xxix"><sup>12</sup></a>; plural
<i>geasa</i>) has as much right to a place in the English vocabulary
as the Polynesian word <i>tabu</i>, by which it is often translated.
It is sometimes Englished &quot;injunction,&quot; &quot;condition,&quot;
&quot;prohibition,&quot; &quot;bond,&quot; &quot;ban,&quot; &quot;charm,&quot; &quot;magical decree,&quot;
or translated by the Scots-Gaelic &quot;spells,&quot; none
of which, however, expresses the idea which the word had
according to the ancient laws of Ireland. It was an adjuration
by the honour of a man, and was either positive or
negative. The person adjured was either compelled or
made in duty bound to do a certain thing, or, more commonly,
was prohibited from doing it. The Old Irish <i>gilla</i> is often
translated &quot;vassal,&quot; &quot;youth,&quot; &quot;boy,&quot; &quot;fellow,&quot; &quot;messenger,&quot;
&quot;servant,&quot; &quot;page,&quot; &quot;squire&quot; and &quot;guide,&quot;
but these words bear false connotations for the society
of the time, as does the Anglicised form of the word, &quot;gillie,&quot;
which smacks of modern sport. It meant originally a
youth in the third of the six ages of man. Compare the
sense of the word <i>varlet</i> or <i>valet</i> in English, which was once
&quot;a more honourable title; for all young gentlemen, untill
they come to be eighteen years of age, were termed so&quot;
(Cotgrave), and of the same word in Old French, which was
&quot;un jeune homme de condition honorable&quot; (J. Loth, <i>Les
Mabinogion</i>, I, page 40, note). A <i>liss</i> or <i>rath</i> is a fortified
place enclosed by a circular mound or trench, or both. A
<i>d&ucirc;n</i> is a fortified residence surrounded by an earthen rampart.
In the case of names of places and persons, I have
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx" name="Page_xxx" title="xxx">xxx</a>
thought it best to adhere as closely as possible to the spellings
used in the LL. manuscript itself. It is of the utmost
importance to get the names of Irish places and of Irish
heroes correctly determined and to discard their English
corrupted spellings. There are certain barbarisms, however,
such as Slane (Slemain), Boyne (Boann), and perhaps
even Cooley (Cualnge), which have been stereotyped in
their English dress and nothing is to be gained by reforming
them. The forms <i>Erin</i> (dative of <i>Eriu</i>, the genuine and
poetic name of the island) and <i>Alba</i> have been retained
throughout instead of the hybrids &quot;Ireland&quot; and &quot;Scotland.&quot;
Final <i>e</i> is occasionally marked with a grave (<i>e.g.</i>
Man&egrave;, Dar&egrave;) to show that it is not silent as it often is in
English.</p>

<p>I quite perceive that I have not always succeeded in
reproducing the precise shade of meaning of words certain
of which had become antiquated and even unintelligible
to the native scholars of the later Middle Irish period themselves.
This is especially true of the passages in <i>rosc</i>,
which are fortunately not numerous and which were probably
intentionally made as obscure and allusive as possible,
the object being, perhaps, as much the music of the words
as the sense. Indeed, in some cases, I have considered
myself fortunate if I have succeeded in getting their mere
drift. No one takes to heart more than the present writer
the truth of Zimmer's remark, that &quot;it needs no great
courage to affirm that <i>not one</i> of the living Celtic scholars,
<i>with</i> all the aids at their disposal, possesses such a ready
understanding of the contents of, for example, the most
important Old Irish saga-text, &quot;The Cualnge Cattle-raid,&quot;
as was required thirty or more years ago in Germany of
a good Gymnasium graduate in the matter of the Homeric
poems and <i>without</i> aids of any kind.&quot;<a name="footnotetag13_xxx" id="footnotetag13_xxx" href="#footnote13_xxx"><sup>13</sup></a> However, in

<p>The T&aacute;in has been translated by Bryan O'Looney in a
manuscript entitled &quot;Tain Bo Cualnge. Translated from
the original vellum manuscript known as the Book of
Leinster, in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin. To
which are added the ancient Prologues, Prefaces, and the
Pretales or Stories, Adventures which preceded the principal
Expedition or Tain, from various vellum MSS. in the
Libraries of Trinity College and the Royal Irish Academy,
Dublin, 1872.&quot; (A good translation, for its time. For
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiv" name="Page_xxxiv" title="xxxiv">xxxiv</a>
O'Looney's works on the T&aacute;in, see the Proceedings of the

Literature and Antiquities, Dublin, 1875; for W.J. Hennessy's,
see The Academy, No. 873, Lee, &quot;Dictionary of
National Biography,&quot; xxv, 1891, pages 424-425, and V.
Tourneur, &quot;Esquisse d'une histoire des &eacute;tudes celtiques,&quot;
page 90, note 5.) The Royal Irish Academy contains another
manuscript translation of the T&aacute;in (24, M, 39), by John
O'Daly, 1857. It is a wretched translation. In one place,
O'Daly speaks of William Rily as the translator. L.
Winifred Faraday's &quot;The Cattle-Raid of Cualnge,&quot; London,
1904, is based on LU. and YBL. Two copies of a complete
translation of the LL. text dating from about 1850 is
in the possession of John Quinn, Esq., of New York City.
H. d'Arbois de Jubainville translated the T&aacute;in from the
LL. text, but with many omissions: &quot;Enl&egrave;vement [du
Taureau Divin et] des Vaches de Cooley,&quot; Revue Celtique,
tomes xxviii-xxxii, Paris, 1907 and fl. Eleanor Hull's &quot;The
Cuchullin Saga,&quot; London, 1898, contains (pages 111-227)
an analysis of the T&aacute;in and a translation by Standish
H. O'Grady of portions of the Add. 18748 text. &quot;The T&aacute;in,
An Irish Epic told in English Verse,&quot; by Mary A. Hutton,
Dublin, 1907, and Lady Augusta Gregory's, &quot;Cuchulain of
Muirthemne,&quot; London, 1903, are paraphrases. The episode
&quot;The Boyish Feats of Cuchulinn&quot; was translated by
Eugene O'Curry, &quot;On the Manners and Customs of the
Ancient Irish,&quot; Vol. i, Introduction, pages 359-366, and
the episode &quot;The Fight of Ferdiad and Cuchulaind,&quot; was
translated by W.K. Sullivan, ibid., Vol. ii, Lectures,
Vol. i, Appendix, pages 413-463.</p>

<h2>I. THE PILLOW-TALK</h2>


<p>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1.</span>
<span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 53.</span>
Once of a time, that Ailill and Medb had spread their
royal bed in Cruachan, the stronghold of Connacht, such
was the pillow-talk that befell betwixt them:</p>

<p>Quoth Ailill: &quot;True is the saying, lady, 'She is a well-off
woman that is a rich man's wife.'&quot; &quot;Aye, that she is,&quot;
answered the wife; &quot;but wherefore opin'st thou so?&quot;
&quot;For this,&quot; Ailill replied, &quot;that thou art this day better off
than the day that first I took thee.&quot; Then answered Medb:
&quot;As well-off was I before I ever saw thee.&quot; &quot;It was a wealth,
forsooth, we never heard nor knew of,&quot; Ailill said; &quot;but
a woman's wealth was all thou hadst, and foes from lands
next thine were used to carry off the spoil and booty that
they took from thee.&quot; &quot;Not so was I,&quot; quoth Medb;
&quot;the High King of Erin himself was my sire, Eocho Fedlech
('the Enduring') son of Finn, by name, who was son of
Findoman, son of Finden, son of Findguin, son of Rogen
Ruad ('the Red'), son of Rigen, son of Blathacht, son of
Beothacht, son of Enna Agnech, son of Oengus Turbech.
Of daughters, had he six: Derbriu, Ethne and Ele, Clothru,
Mugain and Medb, myself, that was the noblest and seemliest
of them. 'Twas I was the goodliest of them in bounty
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_2" name="Page_2" title="2">2</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 17.</span>
and gift-giving, <a name="footnotetag1_2" id="footnotetag1_2" href="#footnote1_2"><sup>1</sup></a>in riches and treasures.<a href="#footnote1_2"><sup>1</sup></a> 'Twas I was
best of them in battle and strife and combat. 'Twas I
that had fifteen hundred royal mercenaries of the sons of
aliens exiled from their own land, and as many more of the
sons of freemen of the land. And there were ten men with
every one of these hirelings, <a name="footnotetag2_2" id="footnotetag2_2" href="#footnote2_2"><sup>2</sup></a>and nine men with every hireling,<a href="#footnote2_2"><sup>2</sup></a>
and eight men with every hireling, and seven men
with every hireling, and six men with every hireling, and
five men with every hireling, <a name="footnotetag3_2" id="footnotetag3_2" href="#footnote3_2"><sup>3</sup></a>and four men with every
hireling,<a href="#footnote3_2"><sup>3</sup></a> and three men with every hireling, and two
men with every hireling, and one hireling with every hireling.
These were as a standing household-guard,&quot; continued
Medb; &quot;hence hath my father bestowed one of
the five provinces of Erin upon me, even the province of
Cruachan; wherefore 'Medb of Cruachan' am I called.
Men came from Finn son of Ross Ruad ('the Red'), king
of Leinster, to seel me <a name="footnotetag4_2" id="footnotetag4_2" href="#footnote4_2"><sup>4</sup></a>for a wife, and I refused him;<a href="#footnote4_2"><sup>4</sup></a>
and from Carbre Niafer ('the Champion') son of Ross Ruad
('the Red'), king of Temair,<a name="footnotetaga_2" id="footnotetaga_2" href="#footnotea_2"><sup>a</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag5_2" id="footnotetag5_2" href="#footnote5_2"><sup>5</sup></a>to woo me, and I refused him;<a href="#footnote5_2"><sup>5</sup></a>
and they came from Conchobar son of Fachtna Fathach
('the Mighty'), king of Ulster, <a name="footnotetag6_2" id="footnotetag6_2" href="#footnote6_2"><sup>6</sup></a>and I refused him in like
wise.<a href="#footnote6_2"><sup>6</sup></a> They came from Eocho Bec ('the Small'), and I
went not; for 'tis I that exacted a singular bride-gift, such
as no woman before me had ever required of a man of the
men of Erin, namely, a husband without avarice, without
jealousy, without fear. For should he be mean, the man
with whom I should live, we were ill-matched together,
inasmuch as I am great <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 54a.</span> in largess and gift-giving, and it
would be a disgrace for my husband if I should be better
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_3" name="Page_3" title="3">3</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 34.</span>
at spending than he, <a name="footnotetag1_3" id="footnotetag1_3" href="#footnote1_3"><sup>1</sup></a>and for it to be said that I was superior
in wealth and treasures to him<a href="#footnote1_3"><sup>1</sup></a>, while no disgrace would
it be were one as great as the other<a name="footnotetaga_3" id="footnotetaga_3" href="#footnotea_3"><sup>a</sup></a>. Were my husband
a coward, 'twere as unfit for us to be mated, for I by myself
and alone break battles and fights and combats, and 'twould
be a reproach for my husband should his wife be more full
of life than himself, and no reproach our being equally
bold. Should he be jealous, the husband with whom I
should live, that too would not suit me, for there never was
a time that I had not my paramour<a name="footnotetagb_3" id="footnotetagb_3" href="#footnoteb_3"><sup>b</sup></a>. Howbeit, such a
husband have I found, namely in thee thyself, Ailill son
of Ross Ruad ('the Red') of Leinster. Thou wast not
churlish; thou wast not jealous; thou wast not a sluggard.
It was I plighted thee, and gave purchase-price to thee,

Medb, &quot;for a man dependent upon a woman's maintenance
is what thou art.&quot;<a name="footnotetagd_3" id="footnotetagd_3" href="#footnoted_3"><sup>d</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Nay, not such was my state,&quot; said Ailill; &quot;but two
brothers had I; one of them over Temair, the other over
Leinster; namely, Finn, over Leinster, and Carbre, over
Temair. I left the kingship to them because they were
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_4" name="Page_4" title="4">4</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 52.</span>
older but not superior to me in largess and bounty. Nor
heard I of province in Erin under woman's keeping but
this province alone. And for this I came and assumed the
kingship here as my mother's successor; for Mata of Muresc,
daughter of Magach <a name="footnotetag1_4" id="footnotetag1_4" href="#footnote1_4"><sup>1</sup></a>of Connacht,<a href="#footnote1_4"><sup>1</sup></a> was my mother. And
who could there be for me to have as my queen better than
thyself, being, as thou wert, daughter of the High King of
Erin?&quot; &quot;Yet so it is,&quot; pursued Medb, &quot;my fortune is
greater than thine.&quot; &quot;I marvel at that,&quot; Ailill made
answer, &quot;for there is none that hath greater treasures and
riches and wealth than I: yea, to my knowledge there is not.&quot;</p>

<h2>II. <a name="footnotetag1_5" id="footnotetag1_5" href="#footnote1_5"><sup>1</sup></a>THE OCCASION OF THE T&Aacute;IN<a href="#footnote1_5"><sup>1</sup></a></h2>


<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 62.</span>
Then were brought to them the least precious of their
possessions, that they might know which of them had the
more treasures, riches and wealth. Their pails and their
cauldrons and their iron-wrought vessels, their jugs and
their keeves and their eared pitchers were fetched to them.</p>

<p>Likewise, their rings and their bracelets and their thumb-rings
and their golden treasures were fetched to them, and
their apparel, both purple and blue and black and green,
yellow, vari-coloured and gray, dun, mottled and brindled.</p>

<p>Their numerous flocks of sheep were led in from fields and
meeds and plains. These were counted and compared, and
found to be equal, of like size, of like number; however,
there was an uncommonly fine ram over Medb's sheep, and
he was equal in worth to a bondmaid, but a corresponding
ram was over the ewes of Ailill.</p>

<p>Their horses and steeds and studs were brought from pastures
and paddocks. There was a noteworthy horse in
Medb's herd and he was of the value of a bondmaid; a
horse to match was found among Ailill's.</p>

<p>Then were their numerous droves of swine driven from
woods and shelving glens and wolds. These were numbered
and counted and claimed. There was a noteworthy boar
With Medb, and yet another with Ailill.</p>

<p>Next they brought before them their droves of cattle
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_6" name="Page_6" title="6">6</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 77.</span>
and their herds and their roaming flocks from the brakes
and wastes of the province.</p>

<hr />

<p>These were counted and numbered and claimed, and
were the same for both, equal in size, equal in number,
except only there was an especial bull of the bawn of Ailill,
and he was a calf of one of Medb's cows, and Finnbennach
('the Whitehorned') was his name. But he, deeming it no
honour to be in a woman's possession, <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 54b.</span> had left and gone
over to the kine of the king. And it was the same to Medb
as if she owned not a pennyworth, forasmuch as she had
not a bull of his size amongst her cattle.</p>

<p>Then it was that macRoth the messenger was summoned
to Medb, and Medb strictly bade macRoth to learn where
there might be found a bull of that likeness in any of the
provinces of Erin. &quot;Verily,&quot; said macRoth, &quot;I know
where the bull is that is best and better again, in the province
of Ulster, in the hundred of Cualnge, in the house of Dar&egrave;
son of Fiachna; even Donn Cualnge ('the Brown Bull of
Cualnge') he is called.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go thou to him, macRoth, and ask for me of Dar&egrave; the
loan for a year of the Brown Bull of Cualnge, and at the
year's end he shall have the meed of the loan, to wit, fifty
heifers and the Donn Cualnge himself. And bear thou a
further boon with thee, macRoth. Should the border-folk
and those of the country grudge the loan of that rare
jewel that is the Brown Bull of Cualnge, let Dar&egrave; himself
come with his bull, and he shall get a measure equalling
his own land of the smooth Plain of Ai and a chariot of the
worth of thrice seven bondmaids and he shall enjoy my
own close friendship.&quot;<a name="footnotetaga_6" id="footnotetaga_6" href="#footnotea_6"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

<p>Thereupon the messengers fared forth to the house of
Dar&egrave; son of Fiachna. This was the number wherewith
macRoth went, namely, nine couriers. Anon welcome was
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_7" name="Page_7" title="7">7</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 99.</span>
lavished on macRoth in Dar&egrave;'s house&mdash;fitting, welcome it
was&mdash;chief messenger of all was macRoth. Dar&egrave; asked of
macRoth what had brought him upon the journey and
why he was come. The messenger announced the cause
for which he was come and related the contention between
Medb and Ailill.</p>

<p>&quot;And it is to beg the loan of the Brown Bull of Cualnge
to match the Whitehorned that I am come,&quot; said he; &quot;and
thou shalt receive the hire of his loan, even fifty heifers
and the Brown of Cualnge himself. And yet more I may
add: Come thyself with thy bull and thou shalt have of
the land of the smooth soil of Mag Ai as much as thou
ownest here, and a chariot of the worth of thrice seven bondmaids
and enjoy Medb's friendship to boot.&quot;</p>

<p>At these words Dar&egrave; was well pleased, and he leaped for
joy so that the seams of his flock-bed rent in twain beneath
him.</p>

<p>&quot;By the truth of our conscience,&quot; said he; &quot;however
the Ulstermen take it, <a name="footnotetag1_7" id="footnotetag1_7" href="#footnote1_7"><sup>1</sup></a>whether ill or well,<a href="#footnote1_7"><sup>1</sup></a> this time this
jewel shall be delivered to Ailill and to Medb, the Brown
of Cualnge to wit, into the land of Connacht.&quot; Well
pleased was macRoth at the words of the son of Fiachna.</p>

<p>Thereupon they were served, and straw and fresh rushes
were spread under them. The choicest of food was brought
to them and a feast was served to them and soon they were
noisy and drunken. And a discourse took place between
two of the messengers. &quot;'Tis true what I say,&quot; spoke the
one; &quot;good is the man in whose house we are.&quot; &quot;Of a
truth, he is good.&quot; &quot;Nay, is there one among all the men
of Ulster better than he?&quot; persisted the first. &quot;In sooth,
there is,&quot; answered the second messenger. &quot;Better is
Conchobar whose man he is, <a name="footnotetag2_7" id="footnotetag2_7" href="#footnote2_7"><sup>2</sup></a>Conchobar who holds the
kingship of the province.<a href="#footnote2_7"><sup>2</sup></a> And though all the Ulstermen
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_8" name="Page_8" title="8">8</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 120.</span>
gathered around him, it were no shame for them. Yet is it
passing good of Dar&egrave;, that what had been a task for the four
mighty provinces of Erin to bear away from the land of
Ulster, even the Brown Bull of Cualnge, is surrendered so
freely to us nine footmen.&quot;</p>

<p>Hereupon a third runner had his say: &quot;What is this
ye dispute about?&quot; he asked. &quot;Yon runner says, 'A
good man is the man in whose house we are.'&quot; &quot;Yea,
he is good,&quot; saith the other. &quot;Is there among all the
Ulstermen any that is better than he?&quot; demanded the
first runner further. &quot;Aye, there is,&quot; answered the
second runner; &quot;better is Conchobar whose man he is;
and though all the Ulstermen gathered around him, it
were no shame for them. Yet, truly good it is of Dar&egrave;, that
what had been a task for four of the grand provinces of
Erin to bear away out of the borders of Ulster is handed
over even unto us nine footmen.&quot; &quot;I would not grudge
to see a retch of blood and gore in the mouth whereout
that was said; for, were the bull not given <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 55a.</span> willingly,
yet should he be taken by force!&quot;</p>

<p>At that moment it was that Dar&egrave; macFiachna's chief
steward came into the house and with him a man with
drink and another with food, and he heard the foolish words
of the runners; and anger came upon him, and he set
down their food and drink for them and he neither said to
them, &quot;Eat,&quot; nor did he say, &quot;Eat not.&quot;</p>

<p>Straightway he went into the house where was Dar&egrave;
macFiachna and said: &quot;Was it thou that hast given that
notable jewel to the messengers, the Brown Bull of
Cualnge?&quot; &quot;Yea, it was I,&quot; Dar&egrave; made answer. &quot;Verily,
it was not the part of a king to give him. For it is true
what they say: Unless thou hadst bestowed him of thine
own free will, so wouldst thou yield him in despite of thee
by the host of Ailill and Medb and by the great cunning
of Fergus macRoig.&quot; &quot;I swear by the gods whom I worship,&quot;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_9" name="Page_9" title="9">9</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 143.</span>
<a name="footnotetag1_9" id="footnotetag1_9" href="#footnote1_9"><sup>1</sup></a>spoke Dar&egrave;,<a href="#footnote1_9"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;they shall in no wise take by foul
means what they cannot take by fair!&quot;</p>

<p>There they abide till morning. Betimes on the morrow
the runners arise and proceed to the house where is Dar&egrave;.
&quot;Acquaint us, lord, how we may reach the place where
the Brown Bull of Cualnge is kept.&quot; &quot;Nay then,&quot; saith
Dar&egrave;; &quot;but were it my wont to deal foully with messengers
or with travelling folk or with them that go by the
road, not one of you would depart alive!&quot; &quot;How sayest
thou?&quot; quoth macRoth. &quot;Great cause there is,&quot; replied
Dar&egrave;; &quot;ye said, unless I yielded in good sort, I should yield
to the might of Ailill's host and Medb's and the great
cunning of Fergus.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even so,&quot; said macRoth, &quot;whatever the runners
drunken with thine ale and thy viands have said, 'tis not
for thee to heed nor mind, nor yet to be charged on Ailill
and on Medb.&quot; &quot;For all that, macRoth, this time I will
not give my bull, if ever I can help it!&quot;</p>

<p>Back then the messengers go till they arrive at Cruachan,
the stronghold of Connacht. Medb asks their tidings, and
macRoth makes known the same: that they had not brought
his bull from Dar&egrave;. &quot;And the reason?&quot; demanded
Medb. MacRoth recounts to her how the dispute arose.
&quot;There is no need to polish knots over such affairs as that,
macRoth; for it was known,&quot; said Medb, &quot;if the Brown
Bull of Cualnge would not be given with their will, he would
be taken in their despite, and taken he shall be!&quot;</p>

grey spearhead on a slender shaft in the hand of each man.<a href="#footnote5_11"><sup>5</sup></a>
&quot;Is that Cormac, yonder?&quot; all and every one asked.
&quot;Not he, indeed,&quot; Medb made answer.</p>

<p>The second troop. Newly shorn hair they wore <a name="footnotetag6_11" id="footnotetag6_11" href="#footnote6_11"><sup>6</sup></a>and
manes on the back of their heads,<a href="#footnote6_11"><sup>6</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag7_11" id="footnotetag7_11" href="#footnote7_11"><sup>7</sup></a>fair, comely indeed.<a href="#footnote7_11"><sup>7</sup></a>

When Medb was come to the place where her druid was,
she craved light and augury of him. &quot;Many there be,&quot;
saith Medb, &quot;who do part with their kinsmen and friends
here to-day, and from their homes and their lands, from

and bed-clothes.<a href="#footnote4_21"><sup>4</sup></a> The tent of Fergus macRoig was on his

him; Ith macEtgaith next to that; Fiachu macFiraba,

beside him. And the thirty hundred men of Ulster on
his right hand had he to the end that the whispered talk
and conversation and the choice supplies of food and of
drink might be the nearer to them.</p>

<p>Medb remained in the rear of the host that day in

tidings of Medb: who was eager and who was loath
for the warfare. &quot;Futile for all is the emprise but
for one troop only, <a name="footnotetag5_22" id="footnotetag5_22" href="#footnote5_22"><sup>5</sup></a>namely the division of the Galian

these men?&quot; queried Ailill. &quot;It is not that we blame
them,&quot; Medb made answer.<a href="#footnote6_22"><sup>6</sup></a> &quot;What good service then
have these done that they are praised above all?&quot; asked
Ailill. &quot;There is reason to praise them,&quot; said Medb.

time asleep. And even as their servants and thralls are
distinguished above the servants and thralls of the men of
Erin, so shall their heroes and champions be distinguished

<p>&quot;Not to me oughtest thou thus to speak, O Fergus,&quot;
then cried Medb, &quot;for I have hosts enough to slay and
slaughter thee with the division of Leinstermen round
thee. For there are the seven Man&egrave;, <a name="footnotetag7_23" id="footnotetag7_23" href="#footnote7_23"><sup>7</sup></a>that is, my seven

and I myself with my own body-guard besides. We are
strong enough here to kill and slaughter thee with thy
cantred of the Leinstermen round thee!&quot;</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_24" name="Page_24" title="24">24</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 439.</span>
&quot;for I have with me here <a name="footnotetag1_24" id="footnotetag1_24" href="#footnote1_24"><sup>1</sup></a>in alliance with us Ulstermen,<a href="#footnote1_24"><sup>1</sup></a>
the seven Under-kings of Munster, with their seven cantreds.
<a name="footnotetag2_24" id="footnotetag2_24" href="#footnote2_24"><sup>2</sup></a>Here we have what is best of the youths of Ulster, even
the division of the Black Banishment.<a href="#footnote2_24"><sup>2</sup></a> Here we have what
is best of the noble youths of Ulster, even the division
of the Galian ('of Leinster'). Furthermore, I myself am
bond and surety and guarantee for them, since ever they
left their own native land. <a name="footnotetag3_24" id="footnotetag3_24" href="#footnote3_24"><sup>3</sup></a>I will give thee battle in
the midst of the camp,<a href="#footnote3_24"><sup>3</sup></a> and to me will they hold steadfast
on the day of battle. More than all that,&quot; added
Fergus, &quot;these men shall be no subject of dispute. By
that I mean I will never forsake them. <a name="footnotetag4_24" id="footnotetag4_24" href="#footnote4_24"><sup>4</sup></a>For the rest,
we will care for these warriors, to the end that they get
not the upper hand of the host.</p>

<p>&quot;The number of our force is seventeen cantreds, besides
our rabble and our women-folk&mdash;for with each king was his
queen in Medb's company&mdash;and our striplings; the eighteenth
division is namely the cantred of the Galian.<a href="#footnote4_24"><sup>4</sup></a> This
division of Leinstermen I will distribute among <a name="footnotetag5_24" id="footnotetag5_24" href="#footnote5_24"><sup>5</sup></a>all the
host of<a href="#footnote5_24"><sup>5</sup></a> the men of Erin in such wise that no five men of
them shall be in any one place.&quot; &quot;That pleaseth me
well,&quot; said Medb: &quot;let them be as they may, if only they
be not in the battle-order of the ranks where they now are
in such great force.&quot;</p>

<p>Forthwith Fergus distributed the cantred <a name="footnotetag6_24" id="footnotetag6_24" href="#footnote6_24"><sup>6</sup></a>of the Galian<a href="#footnote6_24"><sup>6</sup></a>
among the men of Erin in such wise that there were not
five men of them in any one place.</p>

<p><sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 57b.</span> Thereupon, the troops set out on their way and march.
It was no easy thing <a name="footnotetag7_24" id="footnotetag7_24" href="#footnote7_24"><sup>7</sup></a>for their kings and their leaders<a href="#footnote7_24"><sup>7</sup></a> to
attend to that mighty host. They took part in the expedition
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_25" name="Page_25" title="25">25</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 453.</span>
according to the several tribes and according to the
several stems and the several districts wherewith they had
come, to the end that they might see one other and know
one other, that each man might be with his comrades and
with his friends and with his kinsfolk on the march. They
declared that in such wise they should go. They also
took counsel in what manner they should proceed on their
hosting. Thus they declared they should proceed: Each
host with its king, each troop with its lord, and each
band with its captain; each king and each prince of
the men of Erin <a name="footnotetag1_25" id="footnotetag1_25" href="#footnote1_25"><sup>1</sup></a>by a separate route<a href="#footnote1_25"><sup>1</sup></a> on his halting
height apart. They took counsel who was most proper
to seek tidings in advance of the host between the two provinces.
And they said it was Fergus, inasmuch as the expedition
was an obligatory one with him, for it was he that
had been seven years in the kingship of Ulster. And
<a name="footnotetag2_25" id="footnotetag2_25" href="#footnote2_25"><sup>2</sup></a>after Conchobar had usurped the kingship and<a href="#footnote2_25"><sup>2</sup></a> after
the murder of the sons of Usnech who were under his protection
and surety, Fergus left the Ultonians, and for
seventeen years he was away from Ulster in exile and in
enmity. For that reason it was fitting that he above all
should go after tidings.</p>

<p>So <a name="footnotetag3_25" id="footnotetag3_25" href="#footnote3_25"><sup>3</sup></a>the lead of the way was entrusted to Fergus.<a href="#footnote3_25"><sup>3</sup></a>
Fergus before all fared forth to seek tidings, and a
feeling of <a name="footnotetag4_25" id="footnotetag4_25" href="#footnote4_25"><sup>4</sup></a>love and<a href="#footnote4_25"><sup>4</sup></a> affection for his kindred of the men
of Ulster came over him, and he led the troops astray in a
great circuit to the north and the south. And he despatched
messengers with warnings to the Ulstermen, <a name="footnotetag5_25" id="footnotetag5_25" href="#footnote5_25"><sup>5</sup></a>who were
at that time in their 'Pains' except Cuchulain and his
father Sualtaim.<a href="#footnote5_25"><sup>5</sup></a> And he began to detain and delay the
host <a name="footnotetag6_25" id="footnotetag6_25" href="#footnote6_25"><sup>6</sup></a>until such time as the men of Ulster should have
gathered together an army.<a href="#footnote6_25"><sup>6</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag7_25" id="footnotetag7_25" href="#footnote7_25"><sup>7</sup></a>Because of affection he did so.<a href="#footnote7_25"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

Medb perceived this and she upbraided him for it, and
chanted the lay:&mdash;</p>

Fergus; &quot;but do thou find another to go before them.&quot;
For all that, Fergus kept his place in the van of the troops.</p>

<p>The four mighty provinces of Erin passed that night on
Cul Silinne. The sharp, keen-edged anxiety for Cuchulain
came upon Fergus and he warned the men of Erin to be on
their guard, because there would come upon them the
rapacious lion, and the doom of foes, the vanquisher of
multitudes, and the chief of retainers, the mangler of great
hosts, the hand that dispenseth <a name="footnotetag3_26" id="footnotetag3_26" href="#footnote3_26"><sup>3</sup></a>treasures,<a href="#footnote3_26"><sup>3</sup></a> and the flaming

After this lay the men of the four grand provinces of
Erin marched <a name="footnotetag1_28" id="footnotetag1_28" href="#footnote1_28"><sup>1</sup></a>on the morrow<a href="#footnote1_28"><sup>1</sup></a> over Moin Coltna ('the

<p>But there is one event to add: Although the division

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 547.</span>
It was on that same day, <a name="footnotetag3_29" id="footnotetag3_29" href="#footnote3_29"><sup>3</sup></a>after the coming of the warning
from Fergus<a href="#footnote3_29"><sup>3</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_29" id="footnotetag4_29" href="#footnote4_29"><sup>4</sup></a>to the Ulstermen,<a href="#footnote4_29"><sup>4</sup></a> that Cuchulain

that their horses grazed in pasture round the pillar-stone
on Ard Cuillenn ('the Height of Cuillenn').
Sualtaim's horses cropped the grass north of the pillar-stone
close to the ground; Cuchulain's cropped the grass
south of the pillar-stone even to the ground and the bare
stones. &quot;Well, O master Sualtaim,&quot; said Cuchulain; &quot;the
thought of the host is fixed sharp upon me <a name="footnotetag8_29" id="footnotetag8_29" href="#footnote8_29"><sup>8</sup></a>to-night,<a href="#footnote8_29"><sup>8</sup></a> so
do thou depart for us with warnings to the men of Ulster,
that they remain not in the smooth plains but that they
betake themselves to the woods and wastes and steep glens
of the province, if so they may keep out of the way of the
men of Erin.&quot; &quot;And thou, lad, what wilt thou do?&quot;
&quot;I must go southwards to Temair to keep tryst with the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_30" name="Page_30" title="30">30</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 556.</span>
maid<a name="footnotetaga_30" id="footnotetaga_30" href="#footnotea_30"><sup>a</sup></a> of Fedlimid Nocruthach ('of the Nine Forms')
<a name="footnotetag1_30" id="footnotetag1_30" href="#footnote1_30"><sup>1</sup></a>Conchobar's daughter,<a href="#footnote1_30"><sup>1</sup></a> according to my own agreement,

such a journey,&quot;<a href="#footnote2_30"><sup>2</sup></a> said Sualtaim, &quot;and leave the Ulstermen
under the feet of their foes and their enemies for the
sake of a tryst with a woman!&quot; &quot;For all that, I needs
must go. For, an I go not, the troth of men will be held
for false and the promises of women held for true.&quot;</p>

<p>Sualtaim departed with warnings to the men of Ulster.
Cuchulain strode into the wood, and there, with a single
blow, he lopped the prime sapling of an oak, root and top,
and with only one foot and one hand and one eye he exerted
himself; and he made a twig-ring thereof and set an
ogam<a name="footnotetagb_30" id="footnotetagb_30" href="#footnoteb_30"><sup>b</sup></a> script on the plug of the ring, and set the ring round
the narrow part of the pillar-stone on Ard ('the Height')
of Cuillenn. He forced the ring till it reached the thick
of the pillar-stone. Thereafter Cuchulain went his way
to his tryst with the woman.</p>

<p>Touching the men of Erin, the account follows here:
They came up to the pillar-stone at Ard Cuillenn,
<a name="footnotetag3_30" id="footnotetag3_30" href="#footnote3_30"><sup>3</sup></a>which is called Crossa Coil to-day,<a href="#footnote3_30"><sup>3</sup></a> and they began
looking out upon the province that was unknown to
them, the province of Ulster. And two of Medb's people
went always before them in the van of the host, at every
camp and on every march, at every ford and every river <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 58b.</span>
and every gap. They were wont to do so <a name="footnotetag4_30" id="footnotetag4_30" href="#footnote4_30"><sup>4</sup></a>that they might
save the brooches and cushions and cloaks of the host, so
that the dust of the multitude might not soil them<a href="#footnote4_30"><sup>4</sup></a> and
that no stain might come on the princes' raiment in the
crowd or the crush of the hosts or the throng;&mdash;these
were the two sons of Nera, who was the son of Nuathar,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_31" name="Page_31" title="31">31</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 575.</span>
son of Tacan, two sons of the house-stewards of Cruachan,
Err and Innell, to wit. Fraech and Fochnam were the
names of their charioteers.</p>

<p>The nobles of Erin arrived at the pillar-stone and they
there beheld the signs of the browsing of the horses, cropping
around the pillar, and they looked close at the rude hoop
which the royal hero had left behind about the pillar-stone.
<a name="footnotetag1_31" id="footnotetag1_31" href="#footnote1_31"><sup>1</sup></a>Then sat they down to wait till the army should come, the
while their musicians played to them.<a href="#footnote1_31"><sup>1</sup></a> And Ailill took
the withy in his hand and placed it in Fergus' hand, and
Fergus read the ogam script graven on the plug of the
withy, and made known to the men of Erin what was the
meaning of the ogam writing that was on it. <a name="footnotetag2_31" id="footnotetag2_31" href="#footnote2_31"><sup>2</sup></a>When
Medb came, she asked, &quot;Why wait ye here?&quot; &quot;Because
of yonder withy we wait,&quot; Fergus made answer; &quot;there
is an ogam writing on its binding and this is what it
saith: 'Let no one go past here till a man be found to
throw a withy like unto this, using only one hand and
made of a single branch, and I except my master Fergus.'
Truly,&quot; Fergus added, &quot;it was Cuchulain threw it, and
it was his steeds that grazed this plain.&quot; And he placed the
hoop in the hands of the druids,<a href="#footnote2_31"><sup>2</sup></a> and it is thus he began to
recite and he pronounced a lay:&mdash;</p>

<p>After that lay: &quot;I pledge you my word,&quot; said Fergus,
&quot;if so ye set at naught yon withy and the royal hero that
made it, <a name="footnotetag3_32" id="footnotetag3_32" href="#footnote3_32"><sup>3</sup></a>and if ye go beyond<a href="#footnote3_32"><sup>3</sup></a> without passing a night's
camp and quarterage here, or until a man of you make a
withy of like kind, using but one foot and one eye and one
hand, even as he made it, <a name="footnotetag4_32" id="footnotetag4_32" href="#footnote4_32"><sup>4</sup></a>certain it is, whether ye be<a href="#footnote4_32"><sup>4</sup></a>
under the ground or in a tight-shut house, <a name="footnotetag5_32" id="footnotetag5_32" href="#footnote5_32"><sup>5</sup></a>the man that
wrote the ogam hereon<a href="#footnote5_32"><sup>5</sup></a> will bring slaughter and bloodshed
upon ye before the hour of rising on the morrow, if
ye make light of him!&quot; &quot;That, surely, would not be pleasing
to us,&quot; quoth Medb, &quot;that any one should <a name="footnotetag6_32" id="footnotetag6_32" href="#footnote6_32"><sup>6</sup></a>straightway<a href="#footnote6_32"><sup>6</sup></a>
spill our blood or besmirch us red, now that we
are come to this unknown province, even to the province of
Ulster. More pleasing would it be to us, to spill another's
blood and redden him.&quot; &quot;Far be it from us to set this
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_33" name="Page_33" title="33">33</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 618.</span>
withy at naught,&quot; said Ailill, &quot;nor shall we make little
of the royal hero that wrought it, rather will we resort to
the shelter of this great wood, <a name="footnotetag1_33" id="footnotetag1_33" href="#footnote1_33"><sup>1</sup></a>that is, Fidduin, ('the
Wood of the D&ucirc;n')<a href="#footnote1_33"><sup>1</sup></a> southwards till morning. There will
we pitch our camp and quarters.&quot;</p>

<p>Thereupon the hosts advanced, and as they went they
felled the wood with their swords before their chariots,
so that Slechta ('the Hewn Road') is still the by-name of
that place where is Partraige Beca ('the Lesser Partry')
south-west of Cenannas na Rig ('Kells of the Kings') near
Cul Sibrille.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag2_33" id="footnotetag2_33" href="#footnote2_33"><sup>2</sup></a>According to other books, it is told as follows: After
they had come to <a name="footnotetag3_33" id="footnotetag3_33" href="#footnote3_33"><sup>3</sup></a>Fidduin<a href="#footnote3_33"><sup>3</sup></a> they saw a chariot and therein
a beautiful maiden. It is there that the conversation
between Medb and Fedelm the seeress took place that
we spoke of before, and it is after the answer she made to
Medb that the wood was cut down: &quot;Look for me,&quot; said
Medb, &quot;how my journey will be.&quot; &quot;It is hard for me,&quot;
the maiden made answer, &quot;for no glance of eye can I cast
upon them in the wood.&quot; &quot;Then it is plough-land this
shall be,&quot; quoth Medb; &quot;we will cut down the wood.&quot;
Now, this was done, so that this is the name of the place,
Slechta, to wit.<a href="#footnote2_33"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag4_33" id="footnotetag4_33" href="#footnote4_33"><sup>4</sup></a>They slept in Cul Sibrille, which is Cenannas.<a href="#footnote4_33"><sup>4</sup></a> A
heavy snow fell on them that night, and so great it
was that it reached to the shoulders<a name="footnotetaga_33" id="footnotetaga_33" href="#footnotea_33"><sup>a</sup></a> of the men and to
the flanks of the horses and to the poles<a name="footnotetagb_33" id="footnotetagb_33" href="#footnoteb_33"><sup>b</sup></a> of the chariots,
so that all the provinces of Erin were one level plane from
the snow. But no huts nor bothies nor tents did they set
up that night, nor did they <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 59.</span> prepare food nor drink, nor
made they a meal nor repast. None of the men of Erin
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_34" name="Page_34" title="34">34</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 630.</span>
wot whether friend or foe was next him until the bright
hour of sunrise on the morrow.</p>

<p>Certain it is that the men of Erin experienced not a
night of encampment or of station that held more discomfort
or hardship for them than that night <a name="footnotetag1_34" id="footnotetag1_34" href="#footnote1_34"><sup>1</sup></a>with the snow<a href="#footnote1_34"><sup>1</sup></a> at
Cul Sibrille. The four grand provinces of Erin moved out
early on the morrow <a name="footnotetag2_34" id="footnotetag2_34" href="#footnote2_34"><sup>2</sup></a>with the rising of the bright-shining
sun glistening on the snow<a href="#footnote2_34"><sup>2</sup></a> and marched on from that
part into another.</p>

<p>Now, as regards Cuchulain: It was far from being early
when he arose <a name="footnotetag3_34" id="footnotetag3_34" href="#footnote3_34"><sup>3</sup></a>from his tryst.<a href="#footnote3_34"><sup>3</sup></a> And then he ate a meal
and took a repast, and <a name="footnotetag4_34" id="footnotetag4_34" href="#footnote4_34"><sup>4</sup></a>he remained until he had<a href="#footnote4_34"><sup>4</sup></a> washed
himself and bathed on that day.</p>

<p>He called to his charioteer to lead out the horses and
yoke the chariot. The charioteer led out the horses and
yoked the chariot, and Cuchulain mounted his chariot.
And they came on the track of the army. They found
the trail of the men of Erin leading past them from that
part into another. &quot;Alas, O master Laeg,&quot; cried Cuchulain,
&quot;by no good luck went we to our tryst with the woman
last night. <a name="footnotetag5_34" id="footnotetag5_34" href="#footnote5_34"><sup>5</sup></a>Would that we had not gone thither nor
betrayed the Ultonians.<a href="#footnote5_34"><sup>5</sup></a> This is the least that might be
looked for from him that keeps guard on the marches, a
cry, or a shout, or an alarm, or to call, 'Who goes the
road?' This it fell not unto us to say. The men of Erin
have gone past us, <a name="footnotetag6_34" id="footnotetag6_34" href="#footnote6_34"><sup>6</sup></a>without warning, without complaint,<a href="#footnote6_34"><sup>6</sup></a>
into the land of Ulster.&quot; &quot;I foretold thee that, O Cuchulain,&quot;
said Laeg. &quot;Even though thou wentest to thy
woman-tryst <a name="footnotetag7_34" id="footnotetag7_34" href="#footnote7_34"><sup>7</sup></a>last night,<a href="#footnote7_34"><sup>7</sup></a> such a disgrace would come
upon thee.&quot; &quot;Good now, O Laeg, go thou for us on the
trail of the host and make an estimate of them, and discover
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_35" name="Page_35" title="35">35</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 649.</span>
for us in what number the men of Erin went by us.&quot;</p>

<p>Laeg came on the track of the host, and he went to the
front of the trail and he came on its sides and he went to
the back of it. &quot;Thou art confused in thy counting, O
Laeg, my master,&quot; quoth Cuchulain. &quot;Confused I must
be,&quot; Laeg replied. <a name="footnotetag1_35" id="footnotetag1_35" href="#footnote1_35"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;It is not confusedly that I should
see, if I should go,&quot; said Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote1_35"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;Come into the
chariot then, and I will make a reckoning of them.&quot; The
charioteer mounted the chariot and Cuchulain went on
the trail of the hosts and <a name="footnotetag2_35" id="footnotetag2_35" href="#footnote2_35"><sup>2</sup></a>after a long while<a href="#footnote2_35"><sup>2</sup></a> he made a
reckoning of them. <a name="footnotetag3_35" id="footnotetag3_35" href="#footnote3_35"><sup>3</sup></a>&quot;Even thou, it is not easy for thee.<a href="#footnote3_35"><sup>3</sup></a>
Thou art perplexed in thy counting, my little Cuchulain,&quot;
quoth Laeg. &quot;Not perplexed,&quot; answered Cuchulain;
<a name="footnotetag4_35" id="footnotetag4_35" href="#footnote4_35"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;it is easier for me than for thee.<a href="#footnote4_35"><sup>4</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag5_35" id="footnotetag5_35" href="#footnote5_35"><sup>5</sup></a>For I have three
magical virtues: Gift of sight, gift of understanding, and
gift of reckoning.<a href="#footnote5_35"><sup>5</sup></a> For I know the number wherewith
the hosts went past us, namely, eighteen cantreds. Nay
more: the eighteenth cantred has been distributed among
<a name="footnotetag6_35" id="footnotetag6_35" href="#footnote6_35"><sup>6</sup></a>the entire host of<a href="#footnote6_35"><sup>6</sup></a> the men of Erin, <a name="footnotetag7_35" id="footnotetag7_35" href="#footnote7_35"><sup>7</sup></a>so that their number
is not clear, namely, that of the cantred of Leinstermen.&quot;<a href="#footnote7_35"><sup>7</sup></a>
<a name="footnotetag8_35" id="footnotetag8_35" href="#footnote8_35"><sup>8</sup></a>This here is the third cunningest <a name="footnotetag9_35" id="footnotetag9_35" href="#footnote9_35"><sup>9</sup></a>and
most difficult<a href="#footnote9_35"><sup>9</sup></a> reckoning that ever was made in Erin.
These were: The reckoning by Cuchulain of the men of
Erin on the T&aacute;in, the reckoning by Lug Lamfota ('Long-hand')
of the host of the Fomorians <a name="footnotetag10_35" id="footnotetag10_35" href="#footnote10_35"><sup>10</sup></a>in the Battle of Moytura,<a href="#footnote10_35"><sup>10</sup></a>
and the reckoning by Incel of the host in the Hostel
of Da Derga.<a href="#footnote8_35"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Now, many and divers were the magic virtues that were
in Cuchulain <a name="footnotetag11_35" id="footnotetag11_35" href="#footnote11_35"><sup>11</sup></a>that were in no one else in his day.<a href="#footnote11_35"><sup>11</sup></a> Excellence
of form, excellence of shape, excellence of build, excellence
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_36" name="Page_36" title="36">36</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 661.</span>
in swimming, excellence in horsemanship, excellence
in chess and in draughts, excellence in battle, excellence
in contest, excellence in single combat, excellence in
reckoning, excellence in speech, excellence in counsel,
excellence in bearing, excellence in laying waste and in
plundering from the neighbouring border.</p>

<p>&quot;Good, my friend Laeg. Brace the horses for us to
the chariot; lay on the goad for us on the horses; drive
on the chariot for us and give thy left<a name="footnotetaga_36" id="footnotetaga_36" href="#footnotea_36"><sup>a</sup></a> board to the hosts,
to see can we overtake the van or the rear or the midst of
the hosts, for I will cease to live unless there fall by my
hand this night a friend or foe of the men of Erin.&quot;</p>

<p>Then it was that the charioteer gave the prick to the
steeds. He turned his left board to the hosts till he arrived
at Turloch<a name="footnotetagb_36" id="footnotetagb_36" href="#footnoteb_36"><sup>b</sup></a> Caille More ('the Creek of the Great Wood')
northwards of Cnogba na Rig ('Knowth of the Kings')
which is called Ath Gabla ('the Ford of the Fork'). <a name="footnotetag1_36" id="footnotetag1_36" href="#footnote1_36"><sup>1</sup></a>Thereupon
Cuchulain went round the host till he came to Ath
Grenca.<a href="#footnote1_36"><sup>1</sup></a> He went into the wood at that place and sprang out
of his chariot, and he lopped off a four-pronged fork, root
and top, with a single stroke <a name="footnotetag2_36" id="footnotetag2_36" href="#footnote2_36"><sup>2</sup></a>of his sword.<a href="#footnote2_36"><sup>2</sup></a> He pointed
and charred it and put a writing in ogam on its side, and
he gave it a long throw from the hinder part of his chariot
with the tip of a single hand, in such wise that two-thirds
of it sank into the ground and only one-third was above
it <a name="footnotetag3_36" id="footnotetag3_36" href="#footnote3_36"><sup>3</sup></a>in the mid part of the stream, so that no chariot could
go thereby on this side or that.<a href="#footnote3_36"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Then it was that the same two striplings surprised him,
namely, the two sons of Nera son of Nuathar son of Tacan,
while engaged in that feat. And they vied which of the
twain <a name="footnotetag4_36" id="footnotetag4_36" href="#footnote4_36"><sup>4</sup></a>would be the first to fight and contend with Cuchuain,
which of them<a href="#footnote4_36"><sup>4</sup></a> would inflict the first wound upon
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_37" name="Page_37" title="37">37</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 680.</span>
him and be the first to behead him. Cuchulain turned
on them, and straightway he struck off their four heads
<a name="footnotetag1_37" id="footnotetag1_37" href="#footnote1_37"><sup>1</sup></a>from themselves <a name="footnotetag2_37" id="footnotetag2_37" href="#footnote2_37"><sup>2</sup></a>Eirr and Indell<a href="#footnote2_37"><sup>2</sup></a> and <a name="footnotetag3_37" id="footnotetag3_37" href="#footnote3_37"><sup>3</sup></a>from Foich and
Fochlam,<a href="#footnote3_37"><sup>3</sup></a> their drivers,<a href="#footnote1_37"><sup>1</sup></a> and he fixed a head of each man
of them on each of the prongs of the pole. And Cuchulain
let the horses of the party go back in the direction of the
men of Erin, to return by the same road, their reins loose
<a name="footnotetag4_37" id="footnotetag4_37" href="#footnote4_37"><sup>4</sup></a>around their ears<a href="#footnote4_37"><sup>4</sup></a> and their bellies red and the bodies
of the warriors dripping their blood down outside on the
ribs of the chariots. <a name="footnotetag5_37" id="footnotetag5_37" href="#footnote5_37"><sup>5</sup></a>Thus he did,<a href="#footnote5_37"><sup>5</sup></a> for he deemed it no
honour nor deemed he it fair to take horses or garments or
arms from corpses or from the dead. And then the troops
saw the horses of the party that had gone out in advance
before them, and the headless bodies of the warriors oozing
their blood down on the ribs of the chariots (<a name="footnotetag6_37" id="footnotetag6_37" href="#footnote6_37"><sup>6</sup></a>and their
crimsoned trappings upon them<a href="#footnote6_37"><sup>6</sup></a>). The van of the army
waited for the rear to come up, and all were thrown into
confusion of striking, that is as much as to say, into a
tumult of arms.</p>

<p>Medb and Fergus and the Man&egrave; and the sons of Maga
drew near. For in this wise was Medb wont to travel, and
nine chariots with her alone; two of these chariots before
her, and two chariots behind, and two chariots at either
side, and her own chariot in the middle between them.
This is why Medb did so, that the turves from the horses'
hoofs, or the flakes of foam from the bridle-bits, or the dust
of the mighty host or of the numerous throng might not
reach the queen's diadem of gold <a name="footnotetag7_37" id="footnotetag7_37" href="#footnote7_37"><sup>7</sup></a>which she wore round
her head.<a href="#footnote7_37"><sup>7</sup></a> &quot;What have we here?&quot; queried Medb. &quot;Not
hard to say,&quot; each and all made answer; <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 60.</span> &quot;the horses
of the band that went out before us are here and their
bodies lacking their heads in their chariots.&quot; They held
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_38" name="Page_38" title="38">38</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 702.</span>
a council and they felt certain it was the sign of a
multitude and of the approach of a mighty host, and that
it was the Ulstermen that had come <a name="footnotetag1_38" id="footnotetag1_38" href="#footnote1_38"><sup>1</sup></a>and that it was a
battle that had taken place before them on the ford.<a href="#footnote1_38"><sup>1</sup></a> And
this was the counsel they took: to despatch Cormac Conlongas,
Conchobar's son, from them to learn what was at
the ford; because, even though the Ulstermen might be
there, they would not kill the son of their own king. Thereupon
Cormac Conlongas, Conchobar's son, set forth and
this was the complement with which he went, ten hundred
in addition to twenty hundred armed men, to ascertain
what was at the ford. And when he was come, he saw
naught save the fork in the middle of the ford, with four
heads upon it dripping their blood down along the stem of
the fork into the stream of the river, <a name="footnotetag2_38" id="footnotetag2_38" href="#footnote2_38"><sup>2</sup></a>and a writing in
ogam on the side,<a href="#footnote2_38"><sup>2</sup></a> and the signs of the two horses and the
track of a single chariot-driver and the marks of a single
warrior leading out of the ford going therefrom to the eastward.
<a name="footnotetag3_38" id="footnotetag3_38" href="#footnote3_38"><sup>3</sup></a>By that time,<a href="#footnote3_38"><sup>3</sup></a> the nobles of Erin had drawn nigh
to the ford and they all began to look closely at the fork.
They marvelled and wondered who had set up the trophy.
<a name="footnotetag4_38" id="footnotetag4_38" href="#footnote4_38"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;Are yonder heads those of our people?&quot; Medb asked.
&quot;They are our people's, and our chosen ones',&quot; answered
Ailill. One of their men deciphered the ogam-writing
that was on the side of the fork, to wit: 'A single man cast
this fork with but a single hand; and go ye not past it
till one man of you throw it with one hand, excepting Fergus.'<a href="#footnote4_38"><sup>4</sup></a>
&quot;What name have ye men of Ulster for this ford
till now, Fergus?&quot; asked Ailill. &quot;Ath Grenca,&quot;<a name="footnotetaga_38" id="footnotetaga_38" href="#footnotea_38"><sup>a</sup></a> answered
Fergus; &quot;and Ath Gabla ('Ford of the Fork') shall
now be its name forever from this fork,&quot; said Fergus.
And he recited the lay:&mdash;</p>

<div>From the fork that's in the ford!&quot;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After the lay, spake Ailill: &quot;I marvel and wonder, O
Fergus, who could have sharpened the fork and slain with
such speed the four that had gone out before us.&quot; &quot;Fitter
it were to marvel and wonder at him who with a single
stroke lopped the fork which thou seest, root and top,
pointed and charred it and flung it the length of a throw
from the hinder part of his chariot, from the tip of a single
hand, so that it sank over two-thirds into the ground and
that naught save one-third is above; nor was a hole first
dug with his sword, but through a grey stone's flag it was
thrust, and thus it is geis for the men of Erin to proceed
to the bed of this ford till one of ye pull out the fork with
the tip of one hand, even as he erewhile drove it down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thou art of our hosts, O Fergus,&quot; said Medb;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_40" name="Page_40" title="40">40</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 753.</span>
<a name="footnotetag1_40" id="footnotetag1_40" href="#footnote1_40"><sup>1</sup></a>avert this necessity from us,<a href="#footnote1_40"><sup>1</sup></a> and do thou draw the
fork for us from the bed of the ford.&quot; &quot;Let a
chariot be brought me,&quot; cried Fergus, <a name="footnotetag2_40" id="footnotetag2_40" href="#footnote2_40"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;till I draw it out,
that it may be seen that its butt is of one hewing.&quot;<a href="#footnote2_40"><sup>2</sup></a> And
a chariot was brought to Fergus, and Fergus laid hold
<a name="footnotetag3_40" id="footnotetag3_40" href="#footnote3_40"><sup>3</sup></a>with a truly mighty grip<a href="#footnote3_40"><sup>3</sup></a> on the fork, and he made splinters
and <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 61a.</span> scraps of the chariot. &quot;Let another chariot
be brought me,&quot; cried Fergus. <a name="footnotetag4_40" id="footnotetag4_40" href="#footnote4_40"><sup>4</sup></a>Another<a href="#footnote4_40"><sup>4</sup></a> chariot was
brought to Fergus, and Fergus made a tug at the fork and
again made fragments and splinters of the chariot, <a name="footnotetag5_40" id="footnotetag5_40" href="#footnote5_40"><sup>5</sup></a>both
its box and its yoke and its wheels.<a href="#footnote5_40"><sup>5</sup></a> &quot;Again let a chariot
be brought me,&quot; cried Fergus. And Fergus exerted his
strength on the fork, and made pieces and bits of the chariot.
There where the seventeen<a name="footnotetaga_40" id="footnotetaga_40" href="#footnotea_40"><sup>a</sup></a> chariots of the Connachtmen's
chariots were, Fergus made pieces and bits of
them all, and yet he failed to draw the fork from the bed of
the ford. &quot;Come now, let it be, O Fergus,&quot; cried Medb;
&quot;break our people's chariots no more. For hadst thou
not been now engaged on this hosting, <a name="footnotetag6_40" id="footnotetag6_40" href="#footnote6_40"><sup>6</sup></a>by this time<a href="#footnote6_40"><sup>6</sup></a> should
we have come to Ulster, driving divers spoils and cattle-herds
with us. We wot wherefore thou workest all this,
to delay and detain the host till the Ulstermen rise from
their 'Pains' and offer us battle, the battle of the T&aacute;in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bring me a swift chariot,&quot; cried Fergus. And his
own chariot was brought to Fergus, and Fergus gave
a tug at the fork, and nor wheel nor floor nor one of the
chariot-poles creaked nor cracked. Even though it was
with his strength and prowess that the one had driven it
down, with his might and doughtiness the other drew it
out,&mdash;the battle-champion, the gap-breaker of hundreds,
the crushing sledge, the stone-of-battle for enemies, the

<span class="sidenoteL">W. 777.</span>
head of retainers, the foe of hosts, the hacking of masses,
the flaming torch and the leader of mighty combat. He
drew it up with the tip of one hand till it reached the slope
of his shoulder, and he placed the fork in Ailill's hand.
Ailill scanned it; he regarded it near. &quot;The fork, meseems,
is all the more perfect,&quot; quoth Ailill; &quot;for a single
stroke I see on it from butt to top.&quot; &quot;Aye, all the more
perfect,&quot; Fergus replied. And Fergus began to sing praise
<a name="footnotetag1_41" id="footnotetag1_41" href="#footnote1_41"><sup>1</sup></a>of Cuchulain,<a href="#footnote1_41"><sup>1</sup></a> and he made a lay thereon:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div>&quot;Here behold the famous fork,</div>
<div>By which cruel Cuchulain stood.</div>
<div>Here he left, for hurt to all,</div>
<div>Four heads of his border-foes!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div>&quot;Surely he'd not flee therefrom,</div>

<div>Though the scatheless<a name="footnotetaga_41" id="footnotetaga_41" href="#footnotea_41"><sup>a</sup></a> Hound this left,</div>
<div>On its hard rind there is gore!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div>&quot;To its hurt the host goes east,</div>
<div>Seeking Cualnge's wild Brown bull.</div>
<div><a name="footnotetag2_41" id="footnotetag2_41" href="#footnote2_41"><sup>2</sup></a>Warriors' cleaving there shall be,<a href="#footnote2_41"><sup>2</sup></a></div>

<div class="stanza">
<div>&quot;I have nothing to relate</div>
<div>As regards Dechtir&egrave;'s son.<a name="footnotetagc_41" id="footnotetagc_41" href="#footnotec_41"><sup>c</sup></a></div>
<div>Men and women hear the tale</div>
<div>Of this fork, how it came here!&quot;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After this lay: &quot;Let us pitch our booths and tents,&quot;
said Ailill, &quot;and let us make ready food and drink, and
let us sing songs and strike up harps, and let us eat and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_42" name="Page_42" title="42">42</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 807.</span>
regale ourselves, for, of a truth, never before nor since knew
the men of Erin a night of encampment or of entrenchment
that held sorer discomfort or distress for them than yester-night.
<a name="footnotetag1_42" id="footnotetag1_42" href="#footnote1_42"><sup>1</sup></a>Let us give heed to the manner of folk to whom
we go and let us hear somewhat of their deeds and famous
tales.&quot;<a href="#footnote1_42"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>They raised their booths and pitched their tents. They got
ready <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 61b.</span> their food and drink, and songs were sung and
harping intoned by them, and feasting and eating indulged
in, <a name="footnotetag2_42" id="footnotetag2_42" href="#footnote2_42"><sup>2</sup></a>and they were told of the feats of Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote2_42"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>And Ailill inquired of Fergus: &quot;I marvel and wonder who
could have come to us to our lands and slain so quickly
the four that had gone out before us. Is it likely that
Conchobar son of Fachtna Fatach ('the Mighty'), High
King of Ulster, has come to us?&quot; &quot;It is never likely that
he has,&quot; Fergus answered; &quot;for a shame it would be to
speak ill of him in his absence. There is nothing he would
not stake for the sake of his honour. For if he had come
hither <a name="footnotetag3_42" id="footnotetag3_42" href="#footnote3_42"><sup>3</sup></a>to the border of the land<a href="#footnote3_42"><sup>3</sup></a>, there would have come
armies and troops and the pick of the men of Erin that are
with him. And even though against him in one and the
same place, and in one mass and one march and one camp,
and on one and the same hill were the men of Erin and
Alba, Britons and Saxons, he would give them battle,
before him they would break and it is not he that would
be routed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A question, then: Who would be like to have come
to us? Is it like that Cuscraid Mend ('the Stammerer')
of Macha would have come, Conchobar's son, from Inis
Cuscraid?&quot; &quot;Nay then, it is not; he, the son of
the High King,&quot; Fergus answered. &quot;There is nothing he
would not hazard for the sake of his honour. For were
it he that had come hither, there would have come the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_43" name="Page_43" title="43">43</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 827.</span>
sons of kings and the royal leaders <a name="footnotetag1_43" id="footnotetag1_43" href="#footnote1_43"><sup>1</sup></a>of Ulster and Erin<a href="#footnote1_43"><sup>1</sup></a>
that are serving as hirelings with him. And though there
might be against him in one and the same place, in one
mass and one march and one camp, and on one and the
same hill the men of Erin and Alba, Britons and Saxons,
he would give them battle, before him they would break
and it is not he that would be routed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ask, then, whether Eogan son of Durthacht, King
of Fernmag, would have come?&quot; &quot;In sooth, it is not
likely. For, had he come hither, the pick of the men of
Fernmag would have come with him, battle he would give
them, before him they would break, and it is not he that
would be routed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ask, then: Who would be likely to have come to us?
Is it likely that he would have come, Celtchai son of
Uthechar?&quot; &quot;No more is it likely that it was he. A
shame it would be to make light of him in his absence,
him the battle-stone for the foes of the province, the head
of all the retainers and the gate-of-battle of Ulster. And
even should there be against him in one place and one
mass and one march and one camp, and on one and the
same hill all the men of Erin from the west to the east,
from the south to the north, battle he would give them,
before him they would break and it is not he that would
be routed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ask, then: Who would be like to have come to us?&quot;
<a name="footnotetag2_43" id="footnotetag2_43" href="#footnote2_43"><sup>2</sup></a>asked Ailill.<a href="#footnote2_43"><sup>2</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_43" id="footnotetag3_43" href="#footnote3_43"><sup>3</sup></a>&quot;I know not,&quot; Fergus replied,<a href="#footnote3_43"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;unless
it be the little lad, my nursling and Conchobar's.
Cuchulain ('the Wolf-dog of Culann the Smith') he is
called. <a name="footnotetag4_43" id="footnotetag4_43" href="#footnote4_43"><sup>4</sup></a>He is the one who could have done the deed,&quot;
answered Fergus. &quot;He it is who could have lopped the tree
with one blow from its root, could have killed the four with
the quickness wherewith they were killed and could have
come to the border with his charioteer.&quot;<a href="#footnote4_43"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_44" name="Page_44" title="44">44</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 843.</span>
&quot;Of a truth,&quot; spake Ailill, &quot;I heard from ye of this
little boy once on a time in Cruachan. What might
be the age of this little boy now?&quot; &quot;It is by no means
his age that is most formidable in him,&quot; answered Fergus.
&quot;Because, manful were his deeds, those of that lad, at a
time when he was younger than he <a name="footnotetag1_44" id="footnotetag1_44" href="#footnote1_44"><sup>1</sup></a>now<a href="#footnote1_44"><sup>1</sup></a> is. <a name="footnotetag2_44" id="footnotetag2_44" href="#footnote2_44"><sup>2</sup></a>In his
fifth year he went in quest of warlike deeds among the
lads of Emain Macha. In his sixth<a name="footnotetaga_44" id="footnotetaga_44" href="#footnotea_44"><sup>a</sup></a> year he went to
learn skill in arms and feats with Scathach,<a href="#footnote2_44"><sup>2</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_44" id="footnotetag3_44" href="#footnote3_44"><sup>3</sup></a>and he went
to woo Emer;<a href="#footnote3_44"><sup>3</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_44" id="footnotetag4_44" href="#footnote4_44"><sup>4</sup></a>in his seventh<a name="footnotetagb_44" id="footnotetagb_44" href="#footnoteb_44"><sup>b</sup></a> year he took arms; in
his seventeenth year he is at this time.&quot;<a href="#footnote4_44"><sup>4</sup></a> &quot;How so!&quot;
exclaimed Medb. &quot;Is there even now amongst the Ulstermen
one his equal in age that is more redoubtable than he?&quot;
&quot;We have not found there <a name="footnotetag5_44" id="footnotetag5_44" href="#footnote5_44"><sup>5</sup></a>a man-at-arms that is harder,<a href="#footnote5_44"><sup>5</sup></a>

nor a wilder warrior, nor a match of his age that would
reach to a third or a fourth <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 62a.</span> the likes of Cuchulain. Thou
findest not there,&quot; Fergus went on, &quot;a hero his peer, <a name="footnotetag8_44" id="footnotetag8_44" href="#footnote8_44"><sup>8</sup></a>nor
a lion that is fiercer, nor a plank of battle,<a href="#footnote8_44"><sup>8</sup></a> nor a sledge of
destruction, <a name="footnotetag9_44" id="footnotetag9_44" href="#footnote9_44"><sup>9</sup></a>nor a gate of combat,<a href="#footnote9_44"><sup>9</sup></a> nor a doom of hosts,
nor a contest of valour that would be of more worth than
Cuchulain. Thou findest not there one that could equal
his age and his growth, <a name="footnotetag10_44" id="footnotetag10_44" href="#footnote10_44"><sup>10</sup></a>his dress<a href="#footnote10_44"><sup>10</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag11_44" id="footnotetag11_44" href="#footnote11_44"><sup>11</sup></a>and his terror,<a href="#footnote11_44"><sup>11</sup></a>
his size and his splendour, <a name="footnotetag12_44" id="footnotetag12_44" href="#footnote12_44"><sup>12</sup></a>his fame and his voice, his shape

anger,<a href="#footnote13_44"><sup>13</sup></a> his dash, his assault and attack, his dealing of

doom and affliction, his roar, his speed, his fury, his rage,
and his quick triumph with the feat of nine men on each
sword's point<a name="footnotetaga_45" id="footnotetaga_45" href="#footnotea_45"><sup>a</sup></a> above him, like unto Cuchulain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We make not much import of him,&quot; quoth Medb.
&quot;It is but a single body he has; he shuns being wounded;
he avoids being taken. They do say his age is but that of
a girl to be wed. <a name="footnotetag1_45" id="footnotetag1_45" href="#footnote1_45"><sup>1</sup></a>His deeds of manhood have not yet
come,<a href="#footnote1_45"><sup>1</sup></a> nor will he hold out against tried men, this young,

not so,&quot;<a href="#footnote2_45"><sup>2</sup></a> replied Fergus, &quot;for manful were the deeds of

<h2>VII. THE YOUTHFUL EXPLOITS OF CUCHULAIN</h2>


<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 865.</span>
&quot;Now this lad was reared in the house of his father and
mother at Dairgthech<a name="footnotetag1_46" id="footnotetag1_46" href="#footnote1_46"><sup>1</sup></a> ('the Oak House' (?)), namely, in
the plain of Murthemne, and the tales of the youths of Emain
were told to him. <a name="footnotetag2_46" id="footnotetag2_46" href="#footnote2_46"><sup>2</sup></a>For there are <a name="footnotetag3_46" id="footnotetag3_46" href="#footnote3_46"><sup>3</sup></a>always<a href="#footnote3_46"><sup>3</sup></a> thrice fifty boys
at play there,&quot; said Fergus.<a href="#footnote2_46"><sup>2</sup></a> &quot;Forasmuch as in this wise
Conchobar passed his reign ever since he, the king, assumed
his sovereignty, to wit: As soon as he arose, forthwith in
settling the cares and affairs of the province; thereafter,
the day he divided in three: first, the first third he spent
a-watching the youths play games of skill and of hurling;
the next third of the day, a-playing draughts and chess,
and the last third a-feasting on meat and <a name="footnotetag4_46" id="footnotetag4_46" href="#footnote4_46"><sup>4</sup></a>a-quaffing<a href="#footnote4_46"><sup>4</sup></a>
ale, till sleep possessed them all, the while minstrels and
harpers lulled him to sleep. For all that I am a long time
in banishment because of him, I give my word,&quot; said
Fergus, &quot;there is not in Erin nor in Alba a warrior the
like of Conchobar.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the lad was told the tales of the boys and the boy-troop
in Emain; and the child said to his mother, he would
go to have part in the games on the play-field of Emain.
&quot;It is too soon for thee, little son,&quot; said his mother; &quot;wait
till there go with thee a champion of the champions of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_47" name="Page_47" title="47">47</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 880.</span>
Ulster, or some of the attendants of Conchobar to enjoin
thy protection and thy safety on the boy-troop.&quot; &quot;I
think it too long for that, my mother,&quot; the little lad answered,
&quot;I will not wait for it. But do thou show me what place
lies Emain <a name="footnotetag1_47" id="footnotetag1_47" href="#footnote1_47"><sup>1</sup></a>Macha.&quot;<a href="#footnote1_47"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_47" id="footnotetag2_47" href="#footnote2_47"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;Northwards, there;<a href="#footnote2_47"><sup>2</sup></a> it is far
away from thee,&quot; said his mother, &quot;the place wherein it
lies, <a name="footnotetag3_47" id="footnotetag3_47" href="#footnote3_47"><sup>3</sup></a>and the way is hard.<a href="#footnote3_47"><sup>3</sup></a> Sliab Fuait lies between thee
and Emain.&quot; &quot;At all hazards, I will essay it,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p>&quot;The boy fared forth and took his playthings with him.
<a name="footnotetag4_47" id="footnotetag4_47" href="#footnote4_47"><sup>4</sup></a>His little lath-shield<a href="#footnote4_47"><sup>4</sup></a> he took, and his hurley of bronze and
his ball of silver; and he took his little javelin for throwing;
and his toy-staff he took with its fire-hardened
butt-end, and he began to shorten the length of his journey
with them. He would give the ball a stroke <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 62b.</span> with the
hurl-bat, so that he sent it a long distance from him.
Then with a second throw he would cast his hurley so
that it went a distance no shorter than the first throw. He
would hurl his little darts, and let fly his toy-staff, and
make a wild chase after them. Then he would catch up
his hurl-bat and pick up the ball and snatch up the dart,
and the stock of the toy-staff had not touched the ground
when he caught its tip which was in the air.</p>

<p>&quot;He went his way to the mound-seat of Emain, where was
the boy-troop. Thrice fifty youths were with Folloman,
Conchobar's son, at their games on the fair-green of Emain.</p>

<p>&quot;The little lad went on to the play-field into the midst
of the boys, and he whipped the ball between his two legs
away from them, nor did he suffer it to travel higher up
than the top of his knee, nor did he let it lower down than
his ankle, and he drove it and held it between his two legs
and not one of the boys was able to get a prod nor a stroke
nor a blow nor a shot at it, so that he carried it over the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_48" name="Page_48" title="48">48</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 904.</span>
brink of the goal away from them. <a name="footnotetag1_48" id="footnotetag1_48" href="#footnote1_48"><sup>1</sup></a>Then he goes to the
youths without binding them to protect him. For no
one used to approach them on their play-field without
first securing from them a pledge of protection. He was
weetless thereof.<a href="#footnote1_48"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Then they all gazed upon him. They wondered and
marvelled. &quot;Come, boys!&quot; cried Folloman, Conchobar's
son, <a name="footnotetag2_48" id="footnotetag2_48" href="#footnote2_48"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;the urchin insults us.<a href="#footnote2_48"><sup>2</sup></a> Throw yourselves all on
yon fellow, and his death shall come at my hands; for it
is geis among you for any youth to come into your game,
without first entrusting his safety to you. And do you all
attack him together, for we know that yon wight is some
one of the heroes of Ulster; and they shall not make it
their wont to break into your sports without first entrusting
their safety and protection to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thereupon they all set upon him together. They cast
their thrice fifty hurl-bats at the poll of the boy's head.
He raises his single toy-staff and wards off the thrice fifty
hurlies, <a name="footnotetag3_48" id="footnotetag3_48" href="#footnote3_48"><sup>3</sup></a>so that they neither hurt him nor harm him,<a href="#footnote3_48"><sup>3</sup></a>
<a name="footnotetag4_48" id="footnotetag4_48" href="#footnote4_48"><sup>4</sup></a>and he takes a load of them on his back.<a href="#footnote4_48"><sup>4</sup></a> Then they
throw their thrice fifty balls at the lad. He raises his upper
arm and his forearm and the palms of his hands <a name="footnotetag5_48" id="footnotetag5_48" href="#footnote5_48"><sup>5</sup></a>against
them<a href="#footnote5_48"><sup>5</sup></a> and parries the thrice fifty balls, <a name="footnotetag6_48" id="footnotetag6_48" href="#footnote6_48"><sup>6</sup></a>and he catches
them, each single ball in his bosom.<a href="#footnote6_48"><sup>6</sup></a> They throw at him
the thrice fifty play-spears charred at the end. The boy
raises his little lath-shield <a name="footnotetag7_48" id="footnotetag7_48" href="#footnote7_48"><sup>7</sup></a>against them<a href="#footnote7_48"><sup>7</sup></a> and fends off
the thrice fifty play-staffs, <a name="footnotetag8_48" id="footnotetag8_48" href="#footnote8_48"><sup>8</sup></a>and they all remain stuck in
his lath-shield.<a href="#footnote8_48"><sup>8</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag9_48" id="footnotetag9_48" href="#footnote9_48"><sup>9</sup></a>Thereupon contortions took hold of
him. Thou wouldst have weened it was a hammering
wherewith each hair was hammered into his head, with such
an uprising it rose. Thou wouldst have weened it was a
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_49" name="Page_49" title="49">49</a>
spark of fire that was on every single hair there. He closed
one of his eyes so that it was no wider than the eye of a
needle. He opened the other wide so that it was as big
as the mouth of a mead-cup.<a name="footnotetaga_49" id="footnotetaga_49" href="#footnotea_49"><sup>a</sup></a> He stretched his mouth
from his jaw-bones to his ears; he opened his mouth wide
to his jaw so that his gullet was seen. The champion's
light rose up from his crown.<a name="footnotetag9_49" id="footnotetag9_49" href="#footnote9_49"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 919.</span>
&quot;It was then he ran in among them. He scattered fifty
king's sons of them over the ground underneath him <a name="footnotetag1_49" id="footnotetag1_49" href="#footnote1_49"><sup>1</sup></a>before
they got to the gate of Emain.<a href="#footnote1_49"><sup>1</sup></a> Five<a name="footnotetagb_49" id="footnotetagb_49" href="#footnoteb_49"><sup>b</sup></a> of them,&quot; Fergus
continued, &quot;dashed headlong between me and Conchobar,
where we were playing chess, even on Cennchaem ('Fair-head')
<a name="footnotetag2_49" id="footnotetag2_49" href="#footnote2_49"><sup>2</sup></a>the chessboard of Conchobar,<a href="#footnote2_49"><sup>2</sup></a> on the mound-seat
of Emain. The little boy pursued them to cut them off.
<a name="footnotetag3_49" id="footnotetag3_49" href="#footnote3_49"><sup>3</sup></a>Then he sprang over the chessboard after the nine.<a href="#footnote3_49"><sup>3</sup></a>
Conchobar seized the little lad by the wrists. &quot;Hold,
little boy. I see 'tis not gently thou dealest with the boy-band.&quot;
&quot;Good reason I have,&quot; quoth the little lad.
<a name="footnotetag4_49" id="footnotetag4_49" href="#footnote4_49"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;From home, from mother and father I came to play with
them, and they have not been good to me.<a href="#footnote4_49"><sup>4</sup></a> I had not a
guest's honour at the hands of the boy-troop on my arrival,
for all that I came from far-away lands.&quot; &quot;How is that?
Who art thou, <a name="footnotetag5_49" id="footnotetag5_49" href="#footnote5_49"><sup>5</sup></a>and what is thy name?&quot;<a href="#footnote5_49"><sup>5</sup></a> asked Conchobar.
&quot;Little Setanta am I, son of Sualtaim. Son am I
to Dechtir&egrave;, thine own sister; and not through thee did
I expect to be thus aggrieved.&quot; &quot;How so, little one?&quot;
said Conchobar. &quot;Knewest thou not that it is forbidden
among the boy-troop, that it is geis for them for any boy
to approach them in their land without first claiming
his protection from them?&quot; &quot;I knew it not,&quot; said the lad.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_50" name="Page_50" title="50">50</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 932.</span>
&quot;Had I known it, I would have been on my guard against
them.&quot; &quot;Good, now, ye boys,&quot; Conchobar cried; &quot;take ye
upon you the protection of the little lad.&quot; &quot;We grant it,
indeed,&quot; they made answer.</p>

<p>&quot;The little lad went <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 63a.</span> <a name="footnotetag1_50" id="footnotetag1_50" href="#footnote1_50"><sup>1</sup></a>into the game again<a href="#footnote1_50"><sup>1</sup></a> under the
protection of the boy-troop. Thereupon they loosed
hands from him, and once more he rushed amongst them
<a name="footnotetag2_50" id="footnotetag2_50" href="#footnote2_50"><sup>2</sup></a>throughout the house.<a href="#footnote2_50"><sup>2</sup></a> He laid low fifty of their
princes on the ground under him. Their fathers thought
it was death he had given them. That was it not, but
stunned they were with front-blows and mid-blows and
long-blows. &quot;Hold!&quot; cried Conchobar. &quot;Why art
thou yet at them?&quot; &quot;I swear by my gods whom I
worship&quot; (said the boy) &quot;they shall all come under my
protection and shielding, as I have put myself under their
protection and shielding. Otherwise I shall not lighten
my hands off them until I have brought them all to earth.&quot;
&quot;Well, little lad, take thou upon thee the protection of
the boy-troop.&quot; &quot;I grant it, indeed,&quot; said the lad.
Thereupon the boy-troop went under his protection and
shielding.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="footnotetag3_50" id="footnotetag3_50" href="#footnote3_50"><sup>3</sup></a>Then they all went back to the play-field, and the boys
whom he had overthrown there arose. Their nurses and
tutors helped them.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, once upon a time,&quot; continued Fergus, &quot;when he
was a gilla, he slept not in Emain Macha till morning.&quot;
&quot;Tell me,&quot; Conchobar said to him, &quot;why sleepest
thou not <a name="footnotetag4_50" id="footnotetag4_50" href="#footnote4_50"><sup>4</sup></a>in Emain Macha, Cuchulain?&quot;<a href="#footnote4_50"><sup>4</sup></a> &quot;I sleep
not, unless it be equally high at my head and my feet.&quot;
Then Conchobar had a pillar-stone set up at his head and
another at his feet, and between them a bed apart was made
for him.</p>

<p>&quot;Another time a certain man went to wake him, and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_51" name="Page_51" title="51">51</a>
the lad struck him with his fist in <a name="footnotetag1_51" id="footnotetag1_51" href="#footnote1_51"><sup>1</sup></a>the neck or in<a href="#footnote1_51"><sup>1</sup></a> the
forehead, so that it drove in the front of his forehead on to
his brain and he overthrew the pillar-stone with his forearm.&quot;
&quot;It is known,&quot; exclaimed Ailill, &quot;that that was
the fist of a champion and the arm of a hero.&quot; &quot;And
from that time,&quot; continued Fergus, &quot;no one durst wake
him, so that he used to wake of himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, another time, he played ball on the play-field
east of Emain, and he was alone on one side against the
thrice fifty boys. He always worsted in every game in
the east (?) in this way. Thereafter the lad began to use
his fists on them, so that fifty boys of them died thereof.
He took to flight then, till he took refuge under the cushion
of Conchobar's couch. The Ulstermen sprang up all
around him. I, too, sprang up, and Conchobar, thereat.
The lad himself rose up under the couch, so that he hove
up the couch and the thirty warriors that were on it withal,
so that he bore it into the middle of the house. Straightway
the Ulstermen sat around him in the house. We
settled it then,&quot; continued Fergus, &quot;and reconciled the
boy-troop to him afterwards.</p>

<p>&quot;The broil of war arose between Ulster and Eogan son
of Durthacht. The Ulstermen go forth to the war. The
lad Setanta is left behind asleep. The men of Ulster are
beaten. Conchobar and Cuscraid Menn ('the Stammerer')
of Macha are left on the field and many besides them.
Their groans awaken the lad. Thereat he stretches himself,
so that the two stones are snapped that are near him.
This took place in the presence of Bricriu yonder,&quot; Fergus
added. &quot;Then he gets up. I meet him at the door of the
liss, I being severely wounded. &quot;Hey, God keep thy
life,<a name="footnotetaga_51" id="footnotetaga_51" href="#footnotea_51"><sup>a</sup></a> O Fergus my master,&quot; says he; &quot;where is Conchobar?&quot;
&quot;I know not,&quot; I answer. Thereupon he goes
out. The night is dark. He makes for the battlefield,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_52" name="Page_52" title="52">52</a>
until he sees before him a man and half his head on him
and half of another man on his back. &quot;Help me, Cuchulain,&quot;
he cries; &quot;I have been stricken, and I bear on my
back half of my brother. Carry it for me a while.&quot; &quot;I
will not carry it,&quot; says he. Thereupon the man throws
the load at him. Cuchulain throws it back from him.
They grapple with one another. Cuchulain is overthrown.
Then I heard something. It was Badb<a name="footnotetaga_52" id="footnotetaga_52" href="#footnotea_52"><sup>a</sup></a> from the corpses:
&quot;Ill the stuff of a warrior that is there under the feet of a
phantom.&quot; Thereat Cuchulain arises from underneath
him, and he strikes off his head with his playing-stick and
proceeds to drive the ball before him over the field of battle.</p>

<p>&quot;Is my master Conchobar on this battle-field?&quot; That
one makes answer. He goes towards him, to where he
espies him in a ditch and the earth piled around him on
both sides to hide him. &quot;Wherefore art thou come to the
battle-field?&quot; Conchobar asks; &quot;is it that thou mightst
see mortal terror there?&quot; Then Cuchulain lifts him out
of the ditch. The six strong men of Ulster that were with
us could not have lifted him out more bravely. &quot;Get
thee before us to yonder house,&quot; says Conchobar, <a name="footnotetag1_52" id="footnotetag1_52" href="#footnote1_52"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;to
make me a fire there.&quot; He kindles a great fire for him.
&quot;Good now,&quot; quoth Conchobar,<a href="#footnote1_52"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;if one would bring me
a roast pig, I would live.&quot; &quot;I will go fetch it,&quot; says Cuchulain.
Thereupon he sallies out, when he sees a man at a
cooking-pit in the heart of the wood. One of his hands
holds his weapons therein, the other roasts the pork. Ill-favoured,
indeed, is the man. For the which, Cuchulain
attacks him and takes his head and his pig with him. Conchobar
eats the pig then. &quot;Let us go to our house,&quot; says
Conchobar. They meet Cuscraid son of Conchobar and
there were heavy wounds on him. Cuchulain carries him
on his back. The three then proceed to Emain Macha.</p>

<p>&quot;Another time the Ulstermen were in their 'Pains.'
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_53" name="Page_53" title="53">53</a>
Now, there was no 'Pains' amongst us,&quot; Fergus continued,
&quot;in women or boys, nor in any one outside the borders of
Ulster, nor in Cuchulain and his father. <a name="footnotetag1_53" id="footnotetag1_53" href="#footnote1_53"><sup>1</sup></a>It was for this
reason no one dared shed the blood of the men of Ulster,
for that the 'Pains' fell on the one that wounded them.<a href="#footnote1_53"><sup>1</sup></a>
There came thrice nine men from the Isles of Faiche. They
pass over our rear fort, the whiles we are in our 'Pains.'
The women scream in the fort. The youths are in the play-field.
They come at the cry. When the boys catch
sight of the swarthy men, they all take to flight save Cuchulain
alone. He hurls the hand-stones and his playing-staff
at them. He slays nine of them and they leave fifty wounds
on him and proceed thence on their journey.<a name="footnotetag3_53" id="footnotetag3_53" href="#footnote3_53"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 947.</span>
&quot;A youngster did that deed,&quot; Fergus continued, &quot;at the
close of five years after his birth, when he overthrew the
sons of champions and warriors at the very door of their liss
and d&ucirc;n. No need is there of wonder or surprise, <a name="footnotetag2_53" id="footnotetag2_53" href="#footnote2_53"><sup>2</sup></a>if
he should do great deeds,<a href="#footnote2_53"><sup>2</sup></a> if he should come to the confines
of the land, if he should cut off the four-pronged
fork, if he should slay one man or two men or three men
or four men, when there are seventeen full years of him
now on the Cattle-lifting of Cualnge.&quot; <a name="footnotetag4_53" id="footnotetag4_53" href="#footnote4_53"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;In sooth, then,
we know that youth,&quot; spoke out Conall Cernach ('the Victorious'),
&quot;and it is all the better we should know him,
for he is a fosterling of our own.&quot;<a href="#footnote4_53"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<h2><span class="sc">VIIa</span>. THE SLAYING OF THE SMITH'S HOUND BY CUCHULAIN, AND THE REASON HE IS CALLED CUCHULAIN</h2>


<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 956.</span>
Then it was that Cormac Conlongas son of Conchobar
spake: &quot;Again that little lad performed a second deed
in the following year.&quot; &quot;What deed was that?&quot; asked
Ailill.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag1_54" id="footnotetag1_54" href="#footnote1_54"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;A goodly smith there was in the land of Ulster, Culann
the Smith, by name.<a href="#footnote1_54"><sup>1</sup></a> He made ready a feast for Conchobar
and set out for Emain to invite him. He made
known to him that only a few should come with him, that
he should bring none but a true guest along, forasmuch
as it was not a domain or lands of his own that he had, but
<a name="footnotetag2_54" id="footnotetag2_54" href="#footnote2_54"><sup>2</sup></a>the fruit of his two hands,<a href="#footnote2_54"><sup>2</sup></a> his sledges and anvils, his
fists and his tongs. Conchobar replied that only a few
would go to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Culann went back to the stithy to prepare and make
ready meat and drink <a name="footnotetag3_54" id="footnotetag3_54" href="#footnote3_54"><sup>3</sup></a>in readiness for the king.<a href="#footnote3_54"><sup>3</sup></a> Conchobar
sat in Emain till it was time to set out <a name="footnotetag4_54" id="footnotetag4_54" href="#footnote4_54"><sup>4</sup></a>for the
feast,<a href="#footnote4_54"><sup>4</sup></a> till came the close of the day. The king put his
fine, light travelling apparel about him, <a name="footnotetag5_54" id="footnotetag5_54" href="#footnote5_54"><sup>5</sup></a>and went with
fifty chariot-chiefs of those that were noblest and most
illustrious of the heroes,<a href="#footnote5_54"><sup>5</sup></a> and betook him to the boys
<a name="footnotetag6_54" id="footnotetag6_54" href="#footnote6_54"><sup>6</sup></a>before starting,<a href="#footnote6_54"><sup>6</sup></a> to bid them farewell. <a name="footnotetag7_54" id="footnotetag7_54" href="#footnote7_55"><sup>7</sup></a>It was always
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_55" name="Page_55" title="55">55</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 968.</span>
his custom to visit and revisit them when going and coming,
to seek his blessing of the boys.<a name="footnotetag7_55" id="footnotetag7_55" href="#footnote7_55"><sup>7</sup></a> Conchobar came on to
the fair-green, and he saw a thing that astounded him:
Thrice fifty boys at one end of the green and a single boy
at the other, and the single boy won the victory at the goal
and at hurling from the thrice fifty boys. When it was
at hole-play they were&mdash;a game of hole that used to be
played on the fair-green of Emain&mdash;and it was their turn
to drive and his to keep guard, he would catch the thrice
fifty balls just outside of the hole, and not one went by
him into the hole. When it was their turn to keep guard
and his to drive, he would send the thrice fifty balls into
the hole without fail, <a name="footnotetag1_55" id="footnotetag1_55" href="#footnote1_55"><sup>1</sup></a>and the boys were unable to ward
them off.<a href="#footnote1_55"><sup>1</sup></a> When it was at tearing off each other's garments
they played, he would strip off them their thrice fifty
suits <a name="footnotetag2_55" id="footnotetag2_55" href="#footnote2_55"><sup>2</sup></a>so that they were quite naked,<a href="#footnote2_55"><sup>2</sup></a> and they were not
able all of them to take as much as the brooch from his
mantle. When it was at wrestling they were, he would
throw those same thrice fifty boys to the ground under him,
and they did not succeed all of them around him in lifting
him up. Conchobar looked with wonder at the little lad.
&quot;O, ye youths,&quot; cried <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 63b.</span> Conchobar. &quot;Hail to the land
whence cometh the lad ye see, if the deeds of his manhood
shall be such as are those of his boyhood!&quot; &quot;Tis not
just to speak thus,&quot; exclaimed Fergus; &quot;e'en as the
little lad grows, so will his deeds of manhood grow with
him.&quot; &quot;The little lad shall be called to us, that he may
come with us to enjoy the feast to which we go.&quot; The
little lad was summoned to Conchobar. &quot;Good, my lad,&quot;
said Conchobar. &quot;Come thou with us to enjoy the feast
whereto we go, <a name="footnotetag3_55" id="footnotetag3_55" href="#footnote3_55"><sup>3</sup></a>for thou art a guest.&quot;<a href="#footnote3_55"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;Nay, but I
will not go,&quot; the little boy answered. &quot;How so?&quot; asked Conchobar.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_56" name="Page_56" title="56">56</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 990.</span>
&quot;Forasmuch as the boys have not yet had their
fill of games and of sport, and I will not leave them till
they have had enough play.&quot; &quot;It is too long for us to
await thee till then, little boy, and by no means shall we
wait.&quot; &quot;Go then before us,&quot; said the little boy, &quot;and I
will follow after ye.&quot; &quot;Thou knowest naught of the way,
little boy,&quot; said Conchobar. &quot;I will follow the trail of
the company and of the horses and chariots.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thereafter Conchobar came to the house of Culann the
Smith. The king was waited upon and all were shown
honour, as befitted their rank and calling and privileges,
nobility and gentle accomplishment. Straw and fresh rushes
were spread out under them. They commenced to carouse
and make merry. Culann inquired of Conchobar: &quot;Hast
thou, O king, appointed any to come after thee this night
to this d&ucirc;n?&quot; &quot;No, I appointed no one,&quot; replied Conchobar,
for he had forgotten the little lad whom he had
charged to come after him. &quot;Why so?&quot; asked Conchobar.
&quot;An excellent bloodhound have I, <a name="footnotetag1_56" id="footnotetag1_56" href="#footnote1_56"><sup>1</sup></a>that was
brought from Spain.<a href="#footnote1_56"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_56" id="footnotetag2_56" href="#footnote2_56"><sup>2</sup></a>There are three<a name="footnotetaga_56" id="footnotetaga_56" href="#footnotea_56"><sup>a</sup></a> chains upon him,
and three men at each chain. Because of our goods and
our cattle he is slipped and the liss is closed.<a href="#footnote2_56"><sup>2</sup></a> When his
dog-chain is loosed from him, no one dares approach the
same cantred with him to make a course or a circuit, and
he knows no one but myself. The power of hundreds is
in him for strength.&quot; Then spake Conchobar, &quot;Let the
d&ucirc;n be opened for the ban-dog, that he may guard the
cantred.&quot; The dog-chain is taken off the ban-dog, and
he makes a swift round of the cantred. And he comes to
the mound whereon he was wont to keep guard of the stead,
and there he was, his head couched on his paws, and wild,
untameable, furious, savage, ferocious, ready for fight was
the dog that was there.</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_57" name="Page_57" title="57">57</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 1013.</span>
&quot;As for the boys: They were in Emain until the time came
for them to disperse. Each of them went to the house of his
father and mother, of his foster-mother and foster-father.
Then the little lad went on the trail of the party, till he reached
the house of Culann the Smith. He began to shorten the
way as he went with his play-things. <a name="footnotetag1_57" id="footnotetag1_57" href="#footnote1_57"><sup>1</sup></a>He threw his ball
and threw his club after it, so that it hit the ball. The
one throw was no greater than the other. Then he threw
his staff after them both, so that it reached the ball and the
club before ever they fell.<a href="#footnote1_57"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_57" id="footnotetag2_57" href="#footnote2_57"><sup>2</sup></a>Soon the lad came up.<a href="#footnote2_57"><sup>2</sup></a>
When he was nigh to the green of the fort wherein were
Culann and Conchobar, he threw all his play-things before
him except only the ball. The watch-dog descried the lad
and bayed at him, so that in all the countryside was heard
the howl of the watch-hound. And not a division of feasting
was what he was inclined to make of him, but to swallow
him down at one gulp past the cavity <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 64a.</span> of his chest and
the width of his throat and the pipe of his breast. <a name="footnotetag3_57" id="footnotetag3_57" href="#footnote3_57"><sup>3</sup></a>And
it interfered not with the lad's play, although the hound
made for him.<a href="#footnote3_57"><sup>3</sup></a> And the lad had not with him any means
of defence, but he hurled an unerring cast of the ball,
so that it passed through the gullet of the watch-dog's
neck and carried the guts within him out through his back
door, and he laid hold of the hound by the two legs and
dashed him against a pillar-stone <a name="footnotetag4_57" id="footnotetag4_57" href="#footnote4_57"><sup>4</sup></a>that was near him, so that
every limb of him sprang apart,<a href="#footnote4_57"><sup>4</sup></a> so that he broke into bits
all over the ground.<a name="footnotetaga_57" id="footnotetaga_57" href="#footnotea_57"><sup>a</sup></a> Conchobar heard the yelp of the
ban-dog. <a name="footnotetag5_57" id="footnotetag5_57" href="#footnote5_57"><sup>5</sup></a>Conchobar and his people could not move;
they weened they would not find the lad alive before them.<a href="#footnote5_57"><sup>5</sup></a>
&quot;Alas, O warriors,&quot; cried Conchobar; &quot;in no good luck
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_58" name="Page_58" title="58">58</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1029.</span>
have we come to enjoy this feast.&quot; &quot;How so?&quot; asked
all. &quot;The little lad who has come to meet me, my sister's
son, Setanta son of Sualtaim, is undone through the hound.&quot;
As one man, arose all the renowned men of Ulster. Though
a door of the hostel was thrown wide open, they all rushed in
the other direction out over the palings of the fortress. But
fast as they all got there, faster than all arrived Fergus,
and he lifted the little lad from the ground on the slope of
his shoulder and bore him into the presence of Conchobar.
<a name="footnotetag1_58" id="footnotetag1_58" href="#footnote1_58"><sup>1</sup></a>They put him on Conchobar's knee. A great alarm
arose amongst them that the king's sister's son should have
been all but killed.<a href="#footnote1_58"><sup>1</sup></a> And Culann came out, and he saw
his slaughter-hound in many pieces. He felt his heart
beating against his breast. Whereupon he went into the
d&ucirc;n. &quot;Welcome thy coming, little lad,&quot; said Culann,
&quot;because of thy mother and father, but not welcome is
thy coming for thine own sake. <a name="footnotetag2_58" id="footnotetag2_58" href="#footnote2_58"><sup>2</sup></a>Yet would that I had
not made a feast.&quot;<a href="#footnote2_58"><sup>2</sup></a> &quot;What hast thou against the lad?&quot;
queried Conchobar. &quot;Not luckily for me hast thou come
to quaff my ale and to eat my food; for my substance
is now a wealth gone to waste, and my livelihood is a
livelihood lost <a name="footnotetag3_58" id="footnotetag3_58" href="#footnote3_58"><sup>3</sup></a>now after my dog.<a href="#footnote3_58"><sup>3</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_58" id="footnotetag4_58" href="#footnote4_58"><sup>4</sup></a>He hath kept
honour and life for me.<a href="#footnote4_58"><sup>4</sup></a> Good was the friend thou hast
robbed me of, <a name="footnotetag5_58" id="footnotetag5_58" href="#footnote5_58"><sup>5</sup></a>even my dog,<a href="#footnote5_58"><sup>5</sup></a> in that he tended my herds
and flocks and stock for me; <a name="footnotetag6_58" id="footnotetag6_58" href="#footnote6_58"><sup>6</sup></a>he was the protection of
all our cattle, both afield and at home.&quot;<a href="#footnote6_58"><sup>6</sup></a> &quot;Be not angered
thereat, O Culann my master,&quot; said the little boy. <a name="footnotetag7_58" id="footnotetag7_58" href="#footnote7_58"><sup>7</sup></a>&quot;It
is no great matter,<a href="#footnote7_58"><sup>7</sup></a> for I will pass a just judgement upon
it.&quot; &quot;What judgement thereon wilt thou pass, lad?&quot;
Conchobar asked. &quot;If there is a whelp of the breed of that
dog in Erin, he shall be reared by me till he be fit to do
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_59" name="Page_59" title="59">59</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1049.</span>
business as was his sire. <a name="footnotetag1_59" id="footnotetag1_59" href="#footnote1_59"><sup>1</sup></a>Till then<a href="#footnote1_59"><sup>1</sup></a> myself will be the
hound to protect his flocks and his cattle and his land <a name="footnotetag2_59" id="footnotetag2_59" href="#footnote2_59"><sup>2</sup></a>and
even himself<a href="#footnote2_59"><sup>2</sup></a> in the meanwhile. <a name="footnotetag3_59" id="footnotetag3_59" href="#footnote3_59"><sup>3</sup></a>And I will safeguard
the whole plain of Murthemne, and no one will carry off
flock nor herd without that I know it.&quot;<a href="#footnote3_59"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;&quot;Well hast thou given judgement, little lad,&quot; said Conchobar.
&quot;In sooth, we <a name="footnotetag4_59" id="footnotetag4_59" href="#footnote4_59"><sup>4</sup></a>ourselves<a href="#footnote4_59"><sup>4</sup></a> could not give one that
would be better,&quot; said Cathba.<a name="footnotetaga_59" id="footnotetaga_59" href="#footnotea_59"><sup>a</sup></a> &quot;Why should it not be
from this that thou shouldst take the name Cuchulain,
('Wolfhound of Culann')?&quot; &quot;Nay, then,&quot; answered the
lad; &quot;dearer to me mine own name, Setanta son of Sualtaim.&quot;
&quot;Say not so, lad,&quot; Cathba continued; &quot;for the
men of Erin and Alba shall hear that name and the mouths
of the men of Erin and Alba shall be full of that name!&quot;
&quot;It pleaseth me so, whatever the name that is given me,&quot;
quoth the little lad. Hence the famous name that stuck
to him, namely Cuchulain, after he had killed the hound
that was Culann's the Smith's.</p>

<p>&quot;A little lad did that deed,&quot; <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 64b.</span> added Cormac Conlongas
son of Conchobar, &quot;when he had completed six years after
his birth, when he slew the watch-dog that hosts nor
companies dared not approach in the same cantred. No
need would there be of wonder or of surprise if he should
come to the edge of the marches, if he should cut off the
four-pronged fork, if he should slay one man or two men or
three men or four men, now when his seventeen years are
completed on the Cattle-driving of Cualnge!&quot;</p>

in the north-east of Emain, and eight<a name="footnotetaga_60" id="footnotetaga_60" href="#footnotea_60"><sup>a</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag5_60" id="footnotetag5_60" href="#footnote5_60"><sup>5</sup></a>eager<a href="#footnote5_60"><sup>5</sup></a> pupils
in the class of druidic cunning were with him. <a name="footnotetag6_60" id="footnotetag6_60" href="#footnote6_60"><sup>6</sup></a>That is
the number that Cathba instructed.<a href="#footnote6_60"><sup>6</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag7_60" id="footnotetag7_60" href="#footnote7_60"><sup>7</sup></a>One of them<a href="#footnote7_60"><sup>7</sup></a>
questioned his teacher, what fortune and presage might
there be for the day they were in, whether it was good or
whether it was ill. Then spake Cathba: &quot;The little boy
that takes arms <a name="footnotetag8_60" id="footnotetag8_60" href="#footnote8_60"><sup>8</sup></a>this day<a href="#footnote8_60"><sup>8</sup></a> shall be splendid and renowned
<a name="footnotetag9_60" id="footnotetag9_60" href="#footnote9_60"><sup>9</sup></a>for deeds of arms<a href="#footnote9_60"><sup>9</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag10_60" id="footnotetag10_60" href="#footnote10_60"><sup>10</sup></a>above the youths of Erin <a name="footnotetag11_60" id="footnotetag11_60" href="#footnote11_60"><sup>11</sup></a>and
the tales of his high deeds shall be told<a href="#footnote11_60"><sup>11</sup></a> forever,<a href="#footnote10_60"><sup>10</sup></a> but he
shall be short-lived and fleeting.&quot; Cuchulain overheard
what he said, though far off at his play-feats south-west of
Emain; and he threw away all his play-things and hastened
to Conchobar's sleep-room <a name="footnotetag12_60" id="footnotetag12_60" href="#footnote12_60"><sup>12</sup></a>to ask for arms.<a href="#footnote12_60"><sup>12</sup></a> &quot;All
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_61" name="Page_61" title="61">61</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1077.</span>
good attend thee, O king of the Fen&egrave;!&quot; cried the little lad.
&quot;This greeting is the speech of one soliciting something of
some one. What wouldst thou, lad?&quot; said Conchobar.
&quot;To take arms,&quot; the lad made answer. &quot;Who hath
advised thee, little boy?&quot; asked Conchobar. &quot;Cathba the
druid,&quot; said the lad. &quot;He would not deceive thee, little
boy,&quot; said Conchobar. Conchobar gave him two spears
and a sword and a shield. The little boy shook and brandished
the arms <a name="footnotetag1_61" id="footnotetag1_61" href="#footnote1_61"><sup>1</sup></a>in the middle of the house<a href="#footnote1_61"><sup>1</sup></a> so that he
made small pieces and fragments of them. Conchobar gave
him other two spears and a shield and a sword. He shook and
brandished, flourished and poised them, so that he shivered
them into small pieces and fragments. There where were
the fourteen<a name="footnotetaga_61" id="footnotetaga_61" href="#footnotea_61"><sup>a</sup></a> suits of arms which Conchobar had in Emain,
<a name="footnotetag2_61" id="footnotetag2_61" href="#footnote2_61"><sup>2</sup></a>in reserve in case of breaking of weapons or<a href="#footnote2_61"><sup>2</sup></a> for equipping
the youths and the boys&mdash;to the end that whatever boy
assumed arms, it might be Conchobar that gave him the
equipment of battle, and the victory of cunning would be
his thenceforward&mdash;even so, this little boy made splinters
and fragments of them all.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;Truly these arms here are not good, O Conchobar my
master,&quot; the stripling cried. &quot;Herefrom cometh not what
is worthy of me.&quot; Conchobar gave him his own two spears
and his shield and his sword. He shook and he brandished,
he bent and he poised them so that tip touched butt, and
he brake not the arms and they bore up against him, <a name="footnotetag3_61" id="footnotetag3_61" href="#footnote3_61"><sup>3</sup></a>and
he saluted the king whose arms they were.<a href="#footnote3_61"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;Truly,
these arms are good,&quot; said the little boy; &quot;they are
suited to me. Hail to the king whose arms and equipment
these are. Hail to the land whereout he is come!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then Cathba the druid chanced to come into the tent,
and what he said was, &quot;Hath he yonder taken arms?&quot;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_62" name="Page_62" title="62">62</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1101.</span>
Cathba asked. &quot;Aye, then, it must be,&quot; Conchobar
answered. &quot;Not by <a name="footnotetag1_62" id="footnotetag1_62" href="#footnote1_62"><sup>1</sup></a>his<a href="#footnote1_62"><sup>1</sup></a> mother's son would I wish
them to be taken this day,&quot; said Cathba. &quot;How so?
Was it not thyself advised him?&quot; Conchobar asked.
&quot;Not I, in faith,&quot; replied Cathba. &quot;What mean'st thou,
bewitched elf-man?&quot; cried Conchobar <a name="footnotetag2_62" id="footnotetag2_62" href="#footnote2_62"><sup>2</sup></a>to Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote2_62"><sup>2</sup></a>
&quot;Is it a lie thou hast told us?&quot; <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 65a.</span> &quot;But be not wroth
<a name="footnotetag3_62" id="footnotetag3_62" href="#footnote3_62"><sup>3</sup></a>thereat,<a href="#footnote3_62"><sup>3</sup></a> O my master Conchobar,&quot; said the little boy.
<a name="footnotetag4_62" id="footnotetag4_62" href="#footnote4_62"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;No lie have I told;<a href="#footnote4_62"><sup>4</sup></a> for yet is it he that advised me,
<a name="footnotetag5_62" id="footnotetag5_62" href="#footnote5_62"><sup>5</sup></a>when he taught his other pupils this morning.<a href="#footnote5_62"><sup>5</sup></a> For his
pupil asked him what luck might lie in the day, and he said:
The youth that took arms on this day would be illustrious
and famous, <a name="footnotetag6_62" id="footnotetag6_62" href="#footnote6_62"><sup>6</sup></a>that his name would be over the men of Erin
for ever, and that no evil result would be on him thereafter,<a href="#footnote6_62"><sup>6</sup></a>
except that he would be fleeting and short-lived. <a name="footnotetag7_62" id="footnotetag7_62" href="#footnote7_62"><sup>7</sup></a>To the
south of Emain I heard him, and then I came to thee.&quot;<a href="#footnote7_62"><sup>7</sup></a>
&quot;That I avow to be true,&quot; spake Cathba. <a name="footnotetag8_62" id="footnotetag8_62" href="#footnote8_62"><sup>8</sup></a>&quot;Good indeed
is the day,<a href="#footnote8_62"><sup>8</sup></a> glorious and renowned shalt thou be,
<a name="footnotetag9_62" id="footnotetag9_62" href="#footnote9_62"><sup>9</sup></a>the one that taketh arms,<a href="#footnote9_62"><sup>9</sup></a> yet passing and short lived!&quot;
&quot;Noble the gift!&quot; cried Cuchulain. <a name="footnotetag10_62" id="footnotetag10_62" href="#footnote10_62"><sup>10</sup></a>&quot;Little it recks
me,<a href="#footnote10_62"><sup>10</sup></a> though I should be but one day and one night in the
world, if only the fame of me and of my deeds live after
me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="footnotetag11_62" id="footnotetag11_62" href="#footnote11_62"><sup>11</sup></a> Another day one of them asked of the druids for what
that day would be propitious. &quot;The one that mounts a
chariot to-day,&quot; Cathba answered, &quot;his name will be renowned
over Erin for ever.&quot; Now Cuchulain heard that.
He went to Conchobar and said to him, &quot;O Conchobar
my master, give me a chariot!&quot; He gave him a chariot.<a href="#footnote11_62"><sup>11</sup></a>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_63" name="Page_63" title="63">63</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1113.</span>
&quot;Come, lad, mount the chariot, for this is the next thing
for thee.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He mounted the chariot. <a name="footnotetag1_63" id="footnotetag1_63" href="#footnote1_63"><sup>1</sup></a>He put his hands between
the two poles of the chariot,<a href="#footnote1_63"><sup>1</sup></a> and the first chariot he mounted
withal he shook and tossed about him till he reduced it to
splinters and fragments. He mounted the second chariot,
so that he made small pieces and fragments of it in like
manner. Further he made pieces of the third chariot. There
where were the seventeen<a name="footnotetaga_63" id="footnotetaga_63" href="#footnotea_63"><sup>a</sup></a> chariots which Conchobar kept
for the boy-troop and youths in Emain, the lad made small
pieces and fragments of them and they did not withstand
him. &quot;These chariots here are not good, O my master
Conchobar,&quot; said the little boy; &quot;my merit cometh not
from them.&quot; &quot;Where is Ibar<a name="footnotetagb_63" id="footnotetagb_63" href="#footnoteb_63"><sup>b</sup></a> son of Riangabair?&quot; asked
Conchobar. &quot;Here, in sooth, am I,&quot; Ibar answered.
&quot;Take with thee mine own two steeds for him yonder,
and yoke my chariot.&quot; Thereupon the charioteer took
the horses and yoked the chariot. Then the little boy
mounted the chariot <a name="footnotetag2_63" id="footnotetag2_63" href="#footnote2_63"><sup>2</sup></a>and Conchobar's charioteer with
him.<a href="#footnote2_63"><sup>2</sup></a> He shook the chariot about him, and it withstood
him, and he broke it not. &quot;Truly this chariot
is good,&quot; cried the lad, &quot;and this chariot is suited
to me.&quot; <a name="footnotetag3_63" id="footnotetag3_63" href="#footnote3_63"><sup>3</sup></a>The charioteer turned the chariot under him.<a href="#footnote3_63"><sup>3</sup></a>
&quot;Prithee, little boy,&quot; said Ibar, <a name="footnotetag4_63" id="footnotetag4_63" href="#footnote4_63"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;come out<a name="footnotetagc_63" id="footnotetagc_63" href="#footnotec_63"><sup>c</sup></a> of the
chariot now<a href="#footnote4_63"><sup>4</sup></a> and let the horses out on their pasture.&quot;
&quot;It is yet too soon, O Ibar,&quot; the lad answered. <a name="footnotetag5_63" id="footnotetag5_63" href="#footnote5_63"><sup>5</sup></a>&quot;The
horses are fair. I, too, am fair, their little lad.<a href="#footnote5_63"><sup>5</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag6_63" id="footnotetag6_63" href="#footnote6_63"><sup>6</sup></a>Only<a href="#footnote6_63"><sup>6</sup></a>
let us go on a circuit of Emain to-day <a name="footnotetag7_63" id="footnotetag7_63" href="#footnote7_63"><sup>7</sup></a>and thou shalt
have a reward therefor,<a href="#footnote7_63"><sup>7</sup></a> to-day being my first day of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_64" name="Page_64" title="64">64</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1132.</span>
taking arms, to the end that it be a victory of cunning for
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thrice they made the circuit of Emain. &quot;Leave the
horses now to their grazing, O little boy,&quot; said Ibar. &quot;It
is yet too soon, O Ibar,&quot; the little lad answered; &quot;let us
keep on, that the boys may give me a blessing to-day the
first day of my taking arms.&quot; They kept their course to
the place where the boys were. &quot;Is it arms he yonder
has taken?&quot; each one asked. &quot;Of a truth, are they.&quot;
&quot;May it be for victory, for first wounding and triumph.
But we deem it too soon for thee to take arms, because
thou departest from us at the game-feats.&quot; &quot;By no
means will I leave ye, but for luck I took arms this day.&quot;
&quot;Now, little boy, leave the horses to their grazing,&quot;
said Ibar. &quot;It is still too soon for that, O Ibar,&quot; the lad
answered. <a name="footnotetag1_64" id="footnotetag1_64" href="#footnote1_64"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;Ply the goad on the horses,&quot; said he. &quot;What
way, then?&quot; the charioteer asked. &quot;As far as the road
shall lead,&quot; answered Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote1_64"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;And this great road
winding by us, what way leads it?&quot; the lad asked. &quot;What
is that to thee?&quot; Ibar answered. &quot;But thou art a pleasant
wight, I trow, little lad,&quot; quoth Ibar. &quot;I wish, fellow,
to inquire about the high-road of the province, what stretch
it goes?&quot; &quot;To Ath na Foraire ('the Ford of Watching')
in Sliab Fuait it goes,&quot; Ibar answered. &quot;Wherefore is
it called 'the Ford of Watching,' knowest thou?&quot; &quot;Yea, I
know it well,&quot; Ibar made answer. &quot;A stout warrior of Ulster
is on watch and on guard there <a name="footnotetag2_64" id="footnotetag2_64" href="#footnote2_64"><sup>2</sup></a>every day,<a href="#footnote2_64"><sup>2</sup></a> so that there
come no strange youths into Ulster to challenge them to
battle, and he is a champion to give battle in behalf of
the whole province. Likewise if men of song leave the
Ulstermen <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 65b.</span> and the province in dudgeon, he is there to
soothe them by proffering treasures and valuables, and so
to save the honour of the province. Again, if men of song
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_65" name="Page_65" title="65">65</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1155.</span>
enter the land, he is the man that is their surety that they
win the favour of Conchobar, so that songs and lays made
for him will be the first to be sung after their arrival in
Emain.&quot; &quot;Knowest thou who is at the ford to-day?&quot;
&quot;Yea, I know,&quot; Ibar answered; &quot;Conall Cernach ('the
Triumphant'), the heroic, warlike son of Amargin, royal
champion of Erin,&quot; Ibar answered. &quot;Thither guide us,
fellow, that so we reach the ford.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Onwards they drove into sight of the ford where was
Conall. <a name="footnotetag1_65" id="footnotetag1_65" href="#footnote1_65"><sup>1</sup></a>Now it fell to Conall Cernach to guard the province
that day. For each champion of Ulster spent his
day on Sliab Fuait to protect him that came with a lay
or to fight with a warrior, so that some one would be there
to meet him, in order that none might come to Emain
unperceived.<a href="#footnote1_65"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;Are those arms he yonder has taken?&quot; asked
Conall. &quot;Of a truth, are they,&quot; Ibar made answer. &quot;May
it be for victory and for triumph and first wounding,&quot; said
Conall; &quot;but we think it too soon for thee to take arms,
because thou art not yet capable of deeds. Were it surety
he needed, he that should come hither,&quot; he continued,
&quot;so wouldst thou furnish a perfect warrant amongst the
Ulstermen, and the nobles of the province would rise up to
support thee in the contest.&quot; &quot;What dost thou here,
O Conall my master?&quot; asked the lad. &quot;Watch and ward
of the province, lad, I keep here,&quot; Conall made answer.
&quot;Do thou go home now, O master Conall,&quot; said the lad,
&quot;and leave me the watch and guard of the province to
keep here.&quot; &quot;Say not so, little son,&quot; replied Conall;
<a name="footnotetag2_65" id="footnotetag2_65" href="#footnote2_65"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;'twould be enough, were it to protect one that came
with a song; were it to fight with a man, however, that is
still too soon for thee<a href="#footnote2_65"><sup>2</sup></a>; thou art not yet able to cope with
a goodly warrior.&quot; &quot;Then, will I keep on to the south,&quot;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_66" name="Page_66" title="66">66</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1172.</span>
said the little boy, &quot;to Fertas ('the Bank') of Loch Echtrann
for a while; <a name="footnotetag1_66" id="footnotetag1_66" href="#footnote1_66"><sup>1</sup></a>champions are wont to take stand there;<a href="#footnote1_66"><sup>1</sup></a>
perchance I may redden my hands on friend or on foe this
day.&quot; &quot;I will go, little boy,&quot; said Conall, &quot;to save thee,
that thou go not alone <a name="footnotetag2_66" id="footnotetag2_66" href="#footnote2_66"><sup>2</sup></a>into peril<a href="#footnote2_66"><sup>2</sup></a> on the border.&quot; &quot;Not
so,&quot; said the lad. &quot;But I will go,&quot; said Conall; &quot;for the
men of Ulster will blame me for leaving thee to go alone on
the border.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Conall's horses were caught for him and his chariot
was yoked and he set out to protect the little boy. When
Conall came up abreast of him, Cuchulain felt certain that,
even though a chance came to him, Conall would not permit
him to use it. He picked up a hand-stone from the ground
which was the full of his grasp. He hurled it from him
<a name="footnotetag3_66" id="footnotetag3_66" href="#footnote3_66"><sup>3</sup></a>from his sling<a href="#footnote3_66"><sup>3</sup></a> the length of a stone-shot at the yoke
of Conall's chariot, so that he broke the chariot-collar<a name="footnotetaga_66" id="footnotetaga_66" href="#footnotea_66"><sup>a</sup></a> in
two and thereby Conall fell to the ground, so that the
nape of his neck went out from his shoulder. &quot;What have
we here, boy?&quot; asked Conall; <a name="footnotetag4_66" id="footnotetag4_66" href="#footnote4_66"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;why threwest thou
the stone?&quot;<a href="#footnote4_66"><sup>4</sup></a> &quot;It is I threw it to see if my cast be straight,
or how I cast at all, or if I have the stuff of a warrior in me.&quot;
&quot;A bane on thy cast and a bane on thyself as well. E'en
though thou leavest thy head this time with thine enemies,
I will go no further to protect thee.&quot; &quot;'Twas what I
craved of thee,&quot; answered he; &quot;for it is geis amongst you
men of Ulster to proceed, after a mishap has befallen your
chariots. <a name="footnotetag5_66" id="footnotetag5_66" href="#footnote5_66"><sup>5</sup></a>Go back<a href="#footnote5_66"><sup>5</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag6_66" id="footnotetag6_66" href="#footnote6_66"><sup>6</sup></a>to Emain,<a href="#footnote6_66"><sup>6</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag7_66" id="footnotetag7_66" href="#footnote7_66"><sup>7</sup></a>O Conall, and leave
me here to keep watch.&quot; &quot;That pleaseth me well,&quot; replied
Conall.<a href="#footnote7_66"><sup>7</sup></a> Conall turned back northwards again to
the Ford of Watching. <a name="footnotetag8_66" id="footnotetag8_66" href="#footnote8_66"><sup>8</sup></a>Thereafter Conall Cernach went
not past that place.<a href="#footnote8_66"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_67" name="Page_67" title="67">67</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 1192.</span>
As for the little boy, he fared southwards to Fertas
Locha Echtrann. He remained there till the end of the
day <a name="footnotetag1_67" id="footnotetag1_67" href="#footnote1_67"><sup>1</sup></a>and they found no one there before them.<a href="#footnote1_67"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;If we
dared tell thee, little boy,&quot; spoke Ibar, &quot;it were time
for us to return to Emain <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 66a.</span> now; for dealing and carving
and dispensing of food is long since begun in Emain, and
there is a place assigned for thee there. Every day it is
appointed thee to sit between Conchobar's feet, while for
me there is naught but to tarry among the hostlers and
tumblers of Conchobar's household. <a name="footnotetag2_67" id="footnotetag2_67" href="#footnote2_67"><sup>2</sup></a>For that reason,<a href="#footnote2_67"><sup>2</sup></a>
methinks it is time to have a scramble<a name="footnotetaga_67" id="footnotetaga_67" href="#footnotea_67"><sup>a</sup></a> among them.&quot;
&quot;Fetch then the horses for us.&quot; The charioteer fetched the
horses and the lad mounted the chariot. &quot;But, O Ibar,
what hill is that there now, the hill to the north?&quot; the lad
asked. &quot;Now, that is Sliab Moduirn,&quot; Ibar answered. <a name="footnotetag3_67" id="footnotetag3_67" href="#footnote3_67"><sup>3</sup></a>&quot;Let
us go and get there,&quot; said Cuchulain. Then they go on
till they reach it.<a href="#footnote3_67"><sup>3</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_67" id="footnotetag4_67" href="#footnote4_67"><sup>4</sup></a>When they reached the mountain,
Cuchulain asked,<a href="#footnote4_67"><sup>4</sup></a> &quot;And what is that white cairn yonder
on the height of the mountain?&quot; &quot;And that is Finncharn
('the White Cairn') of Sliab Moduirn,&quot; Ibar answered.
&quot;But yonder cairn is beautiful,&quot; exclaimed the lad. &quot;It
surely is beautiful,&quot; Ibar answered. &quot;Lead on, fellow,
till we reach yonder cairn.&quot; &quot;Well, but thou art both a
pleasant and tedious inquisitor, I see,&quot; exclaimed Ibar;
&quot;but this is my first <a name="footnotetag5_67" id="footnotetag5_67" href="#footnote5_67"><sup>5</sup></a>journey and my first<a href="#footnote5_67"><sup>5</sup></a> time with
thee. It shall be my last time till the very day of doom,
if once I get back to Emain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Howbeit they went to the top of the hill. &quot;It is
pleasant here, O Ibar,&quot; the little boy exclaimed. &quot;Point
out to me Ulster on every side, for I am no wise acquainted
with the land of my master Conchobar.&quot; The horseman
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_68" name="Page_68" title="68">68</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1211.</span>
pointed him out Ulster all around him. He pointed him
out the hills and the fields and the mounts of the province
on every side. He pointed him out the plains and the d&ucirc;ns
and the strongholds of the province. &quot;'Tis a goodly sight,
O Ibar,&quot; exclaimed the little lad. &quot;What is that indented,
angular, bordered and glenny plain to the south of us?&quot;
&quot;Mag Breg,&quot; replied Ibar. &quot;Tell thou to me the buildings
and forts of that plain.&quot; The gilla taught him <a name="footnotetag1_68" id="footnotetag1_68" href="#footnote1_68"><sup>1</sup></a>the name of
every chief d&ucirc;n between Temair and Cenannas,<a href="#footnote1_68"><sup>1</sup></a> Temair

slain their father; it was for that reason they were at war
with Ulster.<a href="#footnote5_68"><sup>5</sup></a> &quot;But are those not Necht's sons, that boast
that not more of the Ulstermen are alive than have fallen
at their hands?&quot; &quot;The same, in sooth,&quot; answered the
gilla. &quot;On with us to the d&ucirc;n of the macNechta,&quot;
cried the little boy. &quot;Alas, in truth, that thou sayest
so,&quot; quoth Ibar; <a name="footnotetag7_68" id="footnotetag7_68" href="#footnote7_68"><sup>7</sup></a>&quot;'tis a peril for us.&quot;<a href="#footnote7_68"><sup>7</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag8_68" id="footnotetag8_68" href="#footnote8_68"><sup>8</sup></a>&quot;Truly, not
to avoid it do we go,&quot; answered Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote8_68"><sup>8</sup></a> &quot;We know
it is an act of great folly for us to say so, but whoever may
go,&quot; said Ibar, &quot;it will not be myself.&quot; &quot;Living or dead,
go there thou shalt,&quot; the little boy cried. &quot;'Tis alive I
shall go to the south,&quot; answered Ibar, &quot;and dead I shall
be left at the d&ucirc;n, I know, even at the d&ucirc;n of the macNechta.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They push on to the d&ucirc;n <a href="#footnote1_68"><sup>1</sup></a>and they unharness their
horses in the place where the bog and the river meet south
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_69" name="Page_69" title="69">69</a>

of the d&ucirc;n of the macNechta.<a name="footnotetag1_69" id="footnotetag1_69" href="#footnote1_69"><sup>1</sup></a> And the little boy sprang
out of the chariot onto the green. Thus was the green of the
d&ucirc;n, with a pillar-stone upon it and an iron band around
that, and a band for prowess it was, and there was a writing in
ogam at its joint, and this is the writing it bore: 'Whoever
should come to the green, if he be a champion, it is geis for
him to depart from the green without giving challenge to
single combat.<a href="#footnote1_69"><sup>1</sup></a> The lad deciphered the writing and put his
two arms around the pillar-stone. Just as the pillar-stone
was with its ring, he flung it <a name="footnotetag2_69" id="footnotetag2_69" href="#footnote2_69"><sup>2</sup></a>with a cast of his hand<a href="#footnote2_69"><sup>2</sup></a> into
the moat, so that a wave passed over it. &quot;Methinks,&quot;
spake Ibar, &quot;it is no better now than to be where it was.
And we know thou shalt now get on this green the thing
thou desirest, even the token of death, yea, of doom and
destruction!&quot; <a name="footnotetag3_69" id="footnotetag3_69" href="#footnote3_69"><sup>3</sup></a>For it was the violation of a geis of the
sons of Necht Scen&egrave; to do that thing.<a href="#footnote3_69"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;Good, O Ibar,
spread the chariot-coverings and its skins for me that I
may <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 66b.</span> snatch a little sleep.&quot; &quot;Woe is me, that thou sayest
so,&quot; answered the gilla; &quot;for a foeman's land is this
and not a green for diversion.&quot; <a name="footnotetag4_69" id="footnotetag4_69" href="#footnote4_69"><sup>4</sup></a>And Cuchulain said to
the gilla, &quot;Do not awaken me for a few but awaken me
for many.&quot;<a href="#footnote4_69"><sup>4</sup></a> The gilla arranged the chariot-coverings
and its skins <a name="footnotetag5_69" id="footnotetag5_69" href="#footnote5_69"><sup>5</sup></a>under Cuchulain, and the lad fell asleep on
the green.<a href="#footnote5_69"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Then came one of the macNechta on to the fair-green, to
wit, Foill son of Necht. <a name="footnotetag6_69" id="footnotetag6_69" href="#footnote6_69"><sup>6</sup></a>Then was the charioteer sore
afraid, for he durst not waken him, for Cuchulain had told
him at first not to waken him for a few.<a href="#footnote6_69"><sup>6</sup></a> &quot;Unyoke not
the horses, gilla,&quot; cried Foill. &quot;I am not fain to, at all,&quot;
answered Ibar; &quot;the reins and the lines are still in my
hand.&quot; &quot;Whose horses are those, then?&quot; Foill asked.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_70" name="Page_70" title="70">70</a>

&quot;Two of Conchobar's horses,&quot; answered the gilla; &quot;the
two of the dappled heads.&quot; &quot;That is the knowledge I
have of them. And what hath brought these steeds here
to the borders?&quot; &quot;A tender youth that has assumed
arms amongst us <a name="footnotetag1_70" id="footnotetag1_70" href="#footnote1_70"><sup>1</sup></a>to-day for luck and good omen,&quot;<a href="#footnote1_70"><sup>1</sup></a>
the horseboy answered, &quot;is come to the edges of the marshes
to display his comeliness.&quot; &quot;May it not be for victory
nor for triumph, <a name="footnotetag2_70" id="footnotetag2_70" href="#footnote2_70"><sup>2</sup></a>his first-taking of arms,&quot;<a href="#footnote2_70"><sup>2</sup></a> exclaimed
Foill. <a name="footnotetag3_70" id="footnotetag3_70" href="#footnote3_70"><sup>3</sup></a>&quot;Let him not stop in our land and let the horses
not graze here any longer.<a href="#footnote3_70"><sup>3</sup></a> If I knew he was fit for deeds,
it is dead he should go back northwards to Emain and
not alive!&quot; &quot;In good sooth, he is not fit for deeds,&quot;
Ibar answered; &quot;it is by no means right to say it of him;
it is the seventh year since he was taken from the crib.
<a name="footnotetag4_70" id="footnotetag4_70" href="#footnote4_70"><sup>4</sup></a>Think not to earn enmity,&quot;<a name="footnotetaga_70" id="footnotetaga_70" href="#footnotea_70"><sup>a</sup></a> Ibar said further to the
warrior; &quot;and moreover the child sleepeth.&quot;<a href="#footnote4_70"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;The little lad raised his face from the ground and drew
his hand over his face, and he became as one crimson
wheelball from his crown to the ground. <a name="footnotetag5_70" id="footnotetag5_70" href="#footnote5_70"><sup>5</sup></a>&quot;Not a child
am I, at all, but it is to seek battle with a man that
this child here is come.<a href="#footnote5_70"><sup>5</sup></a> Aye, but I am fit for deeds!&quot;
the lad cried. <a name="footnotetag6_70" id="footnotetag6_70" href="#footnote6_70"><sup>6</sup></a>&quot;That pleaseth me well,&quot; said the
champion;<a href="#footnote6_70"><sup>6</sup></a> &quot;but more like than what thou sayest, meseemeth,
thou art not fit for deeds.&quot; &quot;Thou wilt know
that better if we go to the ford. But, go fetch thy weapons,
for I see it is in the guise of a churl thou art come, and I
slay nor charioteers nor grooms nor folk without arms.&quot;
The man went apace after his arms. <a name="footnotetag7_70" id="footnotetag7_70" href="#footnote7_70"><sup>7</sup></a>&quot;Now<a href="#footnote7_70"><sup>7</sup></a> thou
shouldst have a care for us against yonder man <a name="footnotetag8_70" id="footnotetag8_70" href="#footnote8_70"><sup>8</sup></a>that comes
to meet thee,<a href="#footnote8_70"><sup>8</sup></a> little lad,&quot; said Ibar. &quot;And why so?&quot;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_71" name="Page_71" title="71">71</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1262.</span>
asked the lad. &quot;Foill son of Necht is the man thou seest.
Neither points nor edges of weapons can harm him.&quot; &quot;Not
before me shouldst thou say that, O Ibar,&quot; quoth the lad.
&quot;I will put my hand to the lath-trick for him, namely, to
the apple of twice-melted iron, and it will light upon the
disc of his shield and on the flat of his forehead, and it will
carry away the size of an apple of his brain out through
the back of his head, so that it will make a sieve-hole outside
of his head, till the light of the sky will be visible
through his head.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Foill son of Necht came forth. Cuchulain took the
lath-trick in hand for him and threw it from him the length
of his cast, so that it lighted on the flat of his shield and on
the front of his forehead and carried away the bulk of an
apple of his brain out through the back of his head, so that
it made a sieve-hole thereof outside of his head, till the
light of the sky might be seen through his head. <a name="footnotetag1_71" id="footnotetag1_71" href="#footnote1_71"><sup>1</sup></a>He
went to him then<a href="#footnote1_71"><sup>1</sup></a> and struck off the head from the trunk.
<a name="footnotetag2_71" id="footnotetag2_71" href="#footnote2_71"><sup>2</sup></a>Thereafter he bore away his spoils and his head with
him.<a href="#footnote2_71"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Then came the second son out on the green, <a name="footnotetag3_71" id="footnotetag3_71" href="#footnote3_71"><sup>3</sup></a>his name<a href="#footnote3_71"><sup>3</sup></a>
Tuachall ('the Cunning') son of Necht. &quot;Aha, I see thou
wouldst boast of this deed,&quot; quoth Tuachall. &quot;In the first place
I deem it no cause to boast for slaying one champion,&quot; said
Cuchulain; &quot;thou shalt not boast of it this time, for thou
shalt fall by my hand.&quot; &quot;Off with thee for thine arms, then,
for 'tis not as a warrior thou art come.&quot; The man rushed
after his arms. &quot;Thou shouldst have a care for us against yon
man, lad,&quot; said Ibar. &quot;How so?&quot; the lad asked. &quot;Tuachall
son of Necht is the man thou beholdest. <a name="footnotetag4_71" id="footnotetag4_71" href="#footnote4_71"><sup>4</sup></a>And he
is nowise miss-named, for he falls not by arms at all.<a href="#footnote4_71"><sup>4</sup></a>
Unless thou worstest him with the first blow or with the
first shot or with the first touch, <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 67a.</span> thou wilt not worst him
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_72" name="Page_72" title="72">72</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1283.</span>
ever, because of his craftiness and the skill wherewith he
plays round the points of the weapons.&quot; &quot;That should
not be said before me, O Ibar,&quot; cried the lad. <a name="footnotetag1_72" id="footnotetag1_72" href="#footnote1_72"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;I swear
by the god by whom my people swear, he shall never again
ply his skill on the men of Ulster.<a href="#footnote1_72"><sup>1</sup></a> I will put my hand on
Conchobar's well-tempered lance, on the Craisech Nem&egrave;
('the Venomous Lance'). <a name="footnotetag2_72" id="footnotetag2_72" href="#footnote2_72"><sup>2</sup></a>It will be an outlaw's hand to
him.<a href="#footnote2_72"><sup>2</sup></a> It will light on the shield over his belly, and it
will crush through his ribs on the farther side after piercing
his heart in his breast. That would be the smiting cast of
an enemy and not the friendliness of a fellow countryman!<a name="footnotetaga_72" id="footnotetaga_72" href="#footnotea_72"><sup>a</sup></a>
From me he shall not get sick-nursing or care till the brink
of doom.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tuachall son of Necht came forth on the green, and the
lad laid his hand on Conchobar's lance against him, and
it struck the shield above his belly and broke through
the ribs on the farther side after piercing his heart within
his breast. He struck off his head or ever it reached the
ground. <a name="footnotetag3_72" id="footnotetag3_72" href="#footnote3_72"><sup>3</sup></a>Thereafter Cuchulain carried off his head and
his spoils with him to his own charioteer.<a href="#footnote3_72"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Then came the youngest of the sons forth on the green,
namely, Fandall son of Necht. &quot;Fools were the folk who
fought with thee here,&quot; cried Fandall. &quot;How, now!&quot;
cried the lad. &quot;Come down to the pool, where thy foot
findeth not bottom.&quot; Fandall rushed on to the pool.
&quot;Thou shouldst be wary for us of him, little boy,&quot; said
Ibar. &quot;Why should I then?&quot; asked the lad. &quot;Fandall
son of Necht is the man whom thou seest. For this he
bears the name Fandall ('the Swallow'): like a swallow
or weasel<a name="footnotetagb_72" id="footnotetagb_72" href="#footnoteb_72"><sup>b</sup></a> he courseth the sea; the swimmers of the world
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_73" name="Page_73" title="73">73</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1302.</span>
cannot reach him.&quot; &quot;Thou shouldst not speak thus before
me, O Ibar,&quot; said the lad. <a name="footnotetag1_73" id="footnotetag1_73" href="#footnote1_73"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;I swear, never again will
he ply that feat on the men of Ulster.<a href="#footnote1_73"><sup>1</sup></a> Thou knowest the
river that is in our land, in Emain, the Callann. When
the boys frequent it with their games of sport and when
the water is not beneath them, <a name="footnotetag2_73" id="footnotetag2_73" href="#footnote2_73"><sup>2</sup></a>if the surface is not reached
by them all,<a href="#footnote2_73"><sup>2</sup></a> I do carry a boy over it on either of my palms
and a boy on either of my shoulders, and I myself do not
even wet my ankles under the weight of them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They met upon the water <a name="footnotetag3_73" id="footnotetag3_73" href="#footnote3_73"><sup>3</sup></a>and they engaged in wrestling
upon it,<a href="#footnote3_73"><sup>3</sup></a> and the little boy closed his arms over Fandall,
so that the sea came up even with him, and he gave
him a deft blow with Conchobar's sword and chopped off
his head from the trunk, and left the body to go down with
the stream, and he carried off the head <a name="footnotetag4_73" id="footnotetag4_73" href="#footnote4_73"><sup>4</sup></a>and the spoils<a href="#footnote4_73"><sup>4</sup></a>
with him.</p>

<p>&quot;Thereupon Cuchulain went into the d&ucirc;n and pillaged
the place and burned it so that its buildings were no higher
than its walls. And they turned on their way to Sliab
Fuait and carried the three heads of Necht's sons with
them. <a name="footnotetag5_73" id="footnotetag5_73" href="#footnote5_73"><sup>5</sup></a>Soon Cuchulain heard the cry of their mother
after them, of Necht Scen&egrave;, namely.&quot;<a href="#footnote5_73"><sup>5</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag6_73" id="footnotetag6_73" href="#footnote6_73"><sup>6</sup></a>&quot;Now I
will not give over my spoils,&quot; cried Cuchulain, &quot;till I reach
Emain Macha.&quot; Thereupon Cuchulain and Ibar set out for
Emain Macha with their spoils. It was then Cuchulain
spoke to his charioteer: &quot;Thou didst promise us a good
run,&quot; said Cuchulain, &quot;and we need it now because of the
storm and pursuit that is after us.&quot; Forthwith they hasten
to Sliab Fuait. Such was the speed of the course they
held over Breg, after the urging of the charioteer, that the
horses of the chariot overtook the wind and the birds in
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_74" name="Page_74" title="74">74</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1317.</span>
their flight and Cuchulain caught the throw he had cast
from his sling or ever it reached the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;When they came to Sliab Fuait<a name="footnotetag6_74" id="footnotetag6_74" href="#footnote6_74"><sup>6</sup></a> they espied a herd
of wild deer before them. &quot;What are those many cattle,
O Ibar, those nimble ones yonder?&quot; asked the lad; &quot;are
they tame or are they other deer?&quot; &quot;They are real wild
deer, indeed,&quot; Ibar answered; &quot;herds of wild deer that
haunt the wastes of Sliab Fuait.&quot; <a name="footnotetag1_74" id="footnotetag1_74" href="#footnote1_74"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;Which,&quot; asked
Cuchulain, &quot;would the men of Ulster deem best, to bring
them dead or alive?&quot; &quot;More wonderful, alive,&quot; answered
the charioteer; &quot;not every one can do it so; but
dead, there is none of them cannot do it. Thou canst
not do this, carry off any of them alive.&quot; &quot;Truly I can,&quot;
said Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote1_74"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;Ply the goad for us on the horses <a name="footnotetag2_74" id="footnotetag2_74" href="#footnote2_74"><sup>2</sup></a>into
the bog,<a href="#footnote2_74"><sup>2</sup></a> to see can we take some of them.&quot; The charioteer
drove a goad into the horses. It was beyond the
power of the king's overfat steeds to keep up with the deer.
<a name="footnotetag3_74" id="footnotetag3_74" href="#footnote3_74"><sup>3</sup></a>Soon the horses stuck in the marsh.<a href="#footnote3_74"><sup>3</sup></a> The lad got down
from the chariot and <a name="footnotetag4_74" id="footnotetag4_74" href="#footnote4_74"><sup>4</sup></a>as the fruit of his run and his race, in
the morass which was around him,<a href="#footnote4_74"><sup>4</sup></a> he caught two of the
swift, stout deer. He fastened them to the back poles and
the bows and the thongs of the chariot.</p>

<p>&quot;They continued their way to the mound-seat of Emain,
where they saw flocks of white swans flying by them.
&quot;What are those birds there, O Ibar?&quot; the lad asked;
&quot;are yonder birds tame <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 67.</span> or are they other birds?&quot; &quot;Indeed,
they are real wild birds,&quot; Ibar answered; &quot;flocks
of swans are they that come from the rocks and crags and
islands of the great sea without, to feed on the plains and
smooth spots of Erin.&quot; &quot;Which would be stranger <a name="footnotetag5_74" id="footnotetag5_74" href="#footnote5_74"><sup>5</sup></a>to
the Ulstermen,<a href="#footnote5_74"><sup>5</sup></a> O Ibar, for them to be fetched alive to
Emain or dead?&quot; asked the lad. &quot;Stranger far, alive,&quot;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_75" name="Page_75" title="75">75</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1333.</span>
Ibar answered, &quot;for not every one succeeds in taking the
birds alive, <a name="footnotetag1_75" id="footnotetag1_75" href="#footnote1_75"><sup>1</sup></a>while they are many that take them dead.&quot;<a href="#footnote1_75"><sup>1</sup></a>
Then did the lad perform one of his lesser feats upon them:
<a name="footnotetag2_75" id="footnotetag2_75" href="#footnote2_75"><sup>2</sup></a>he put a small stone in his sling,<a href="#footnote2_75"><sup>2</sup></a> so that he brought down
eight<a name="footnotetaga_75" id="footnotetaga_75" href="#footnotea_75"><sup>a</sup></a> of the birds; and then he performed a greater
feat: <a name="footnotetag3_75" id="footnotetag3_75" href="#footnote3_75"><sup>3</sup></a>he threw a large stone at them<a href="#footnote3_75"><sup>3</sup></a> and he brought
down sixteen<a name="footnotetagb_75" id="footnotetagb_75" href="#footnoteb_75"><sup>b</sup></a> of their number. <a name="footnotetag4_75" id="footnotetag4_75" href="#footnote4_75"><sup>4</sup></a>With his return stroke
all that was done.<a href="#footnote4_75"><sup>4</sup></a> He fastened them to the hind poles
and the bows and the thongs and the ropes and the traces
of the chariot.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;Take the birds along with thee, O Ibar,&quot; cried the
lad <a name="footnotetag5_75" id="footnotetag5_75" href="#footnote5_75"><sup>5</sup></a>to his charioteer. If I myself go to take them,&quot; he
added, &quot;the wild deer will spring upon thee.&quot;<a href="#footnote5_75"><sup>5</sup></a> &quot;I am
in sore straits,&quot; answered Ibar; &quot;<a name="footnotetag6_75" id="footnotetag6_75" href="#footnote6_75"><sup>6</sup></a>I find it not easy to
go.&quot;<a href="#footnote6_75"><sup>6</sup></a> &quot;What may it be?&quot; asked the lad. &quot;Great
cause have I. <a name="footnotetag7_75" id="footnotetag7_75" href="#footnote7_75"><sup>7</sup></a>The horses have become wild, so that I
cannot go by them.<a href="#footnote7_75"><sup>7</sup></a> If I stir at all from where I am, the
chariot's iron wheels will cut me down <a name="footnotetag8_75" id="footnotetag8_75" href="#footnote8_75"><sup>8</sup></a>because of their
sharpness<a href="#footnote8_75"><sup>8</sup></a> and because of the strength and the power
and the might of the career of the horses. If I make any
move, the horns of the deer will pierce and gore me, <a name="footnotetag9_75" id="footnotetag9_75" href="#footnote9_75"><sup>9</sup></a>for
the horns of the stag have filled the whole space between
the two shafts of the chariot.&quot;<a href="#footnote9_75"><sup>9</sup></a> &quot;Ah, no true champion
art thou any longer, O Ibar,&quot; <a name="footnotetag10_75" id="footnotetag10_75" href="#footnote10_75"><sup>10</sup></a>said the lad;<a href="#footnote10_75"><sup>10</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag11_75" id="footnotetag11_75" href="#footnote11_75"><sup>11</sup></a>&quot;step thus
from his horn.<a href="#footnote11_75"><sup>11</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag12_75" id="footnotetag12_75" href="#footnote12_75"><sup>12</sup></a>I swear by the god by whom the
Ulstermen swear,<a href="#footnote12_75"><sup>12</sup></a> because of the look I shall give at the
horses they will not depart from the straight way; at
the look I shall give at the deer they will bend their heads
in fear and awe of me; <a name="footnotetag13_75" id="footnotetag13_75" href="#footnote13_75"><sup>13</sup></a>they will not dare move,<a href="#footnote13_75"><sup>13</sup></a> and

<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1346.</span>
it will be safe for thee e'en though thou goest in front of
their horns.&quot; <a name="footnotetag1_76" id="footnotetag1_76" href="#footnote1_76"><sup>1</sup></a>And so it was done. Cuchulain fastened
the reins.<a href="#footnote1_76"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_76" id="footnotetag2_76" href="#footnote2_76"><sup>2</sup></a>Then<a href="#footnote2_76"><sup>2</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_76" id="footnotetag3_76" href="#footnote3_76"><sup>3</sup></a>the charioteer<a href="#footnote3_76"><sup>3</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_76" id="footnotetag4_76" href="#footnote4_76"><sup>4</sup></a>went and collected
the birds, and he bound them to the hind poles and to the
thongs and the traces of the chariot.<a href="#footnote4_76"><sup>4</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag5_76" id="footnotetag5_76" href="#footnote5_76"><sup>5</sup></a>Thus it was that

<p>&quot;<a name="footnotetag7_76" id="footnotetag7_76" href="#footnote7_76"><sup>7</sup></a>Thereupon<a href="#footnote7_76"><sup>7</sup></a> they went on till <a name="footnotetag8_76" id="footnotetag8_76" href="#footnote8_76"><sup>8</sup></a>bravely, boldly,

<a name="footnotetag12_76" id="footnotetag12_76" href="#footnote12_76"><sup>12</sup></a>and she hastened to Conchobar's house, her eye restless in
her head and her tongue faltering in her jaw.<a href="#footnote12_76"><sup>12</sup></a> &quot;A single
chariot-fighter is here, <a name="footnotetag13_76" id="footnotetag13_76" href="#footnote13_76"><sup>13</sup></a>coming towards Emain Macha,&quot;<a href="#footnote13_76"><sup>13</sup></a>
cried Lebarcham, &quot;and his coming is fearful. The heads
of his foes all red in his chariot with him. Beautiful, all-white
birds he has hovering around in the chariot. With
him are wild, untamed deer, bound and fettered, shackled
and pinioned. And <a name="footnotetag14_76" id="footnotetag14_76" href="#footnote14_76"><sup>14</sup></a>I give my word,<a href="#footnote14_76"><sup>14</sup></a> if he be not attended

&quot;We know him, that chariot-fighter,&quot; spake Conchobar;

who has reddened his hands and is still unsated of combat,
and unless he be attended to, all the youths of Emain will
fall by his hand.&quot; <a name="footnotetag1_77" id="footnotetag1_77" href="#footnote1_77"><sup>1</sup></a>Soon he turned the left<a name="footnotetaga_77" id="footnotetaga_77" href="#footnotea_77"><sup>a</sup></a> side of his
chariot towards Emain, and this was geis for Emain. And
Cuchulain cried, &quot;I swear by the god by whom the Ulstermen
swear, if a man be not found to engage with me, I will
spill the blood of every one in the d&ucirc;n!&quot;<a href="#footnote1_77"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;And this was the counsel they agreed to follow: to let
out the womenfolk to meet the youth, namely, thrice fifty
women, even ten and seven-score bold, stark-naked women,
at one and the same time, and their chieftainess, Scannlach
('the Wanton') before them, to discover their persons and
their shame<a name="footnotetagb_77" id="footnotetagb_77" href="#footnoteb_77"><sup>b</sup></a> to him. <a name="footnotetag2_77" id="footnotetag2_77" href="#footnote2_77"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;Let the young women go,&quot; said
Conchobar, &quot;and bare their paps and their breasts and
their swelling bosoms, and if he be a true warrior he will
not withstand being bound, and he shall be placed in a vat of
cold water until his anger go from him.&quot;<a href="#footnote2_77"><sup>2</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_77" id="footnotetag3_77" href="#footnote3_77"><sup>3</sup></a>Thereupon<a href="#footnote3_77"><sup>3</sup></a> the
young women all <a name="footnotetag4_77" id="footnotetag4_77" href="#footnote4_77"><sup>4</sup></a>arose and<a href="#footnote4_77"><sup>4</sup></a> marched out, <a name="footnotetag5_77" id="footnotetag5_77" href="#footnote5_77"><sup>5</sup></a>and these are the
names of those queens: Sgamalus and Sgannlach and Sgiathan,
Feidlim and Deigtini Finnchas, and Finngheal and Fidniam
and Niam, daughter of Celtchar son of Uthechar<a href="#footnote5_77"><sup>5</sup></a>; and they
discovered their nakedness and all their shame to him.
<a name="footnotetag6_77" id="footnotetag6_77" href="#footnote6_77"><sup>6</sup></a>&quot;These are the warriors that will meet thee to-day,&quot;
quoth Mugain, wife of Conchobar son of Ness.<a href="#footnote6_77"><sup>6</sup></a> The lad
hid his face from them and turned his gaze on the chariot,
that he might not see the nakedness or the shame of the
women.<a name="footnotetagc_77" id="footnotetagc_77" href="#footnotec_77"><sup>c</sup></a> Then the lad was lifted out of the chariot. He
was placed in three vats of cold water to extinguish his
wrath; and the first vat into which he was put burst its
staves and its hoops like the cracking of nuts around him.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_78" name="Page_78" title="78">78</a>

The next vat <a name="footnotetag1_78" id="footnotetag1_78" href="#footnote1_78"><sup>1</sup></a>into which he went<a href="#footnote1_78"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_78" id="footnotetag2_78" href="#footnote2_78"><sup>2</sup></a>boiled with bubbles as big

wrath went down.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="footnotetag4_78" id="footnotetag4_78" href="#footnote4_78"><sup>4</sup></a>Thereupon he came out,<a href="#footnote4_78"><sup>4</sup></a> and his <a name="footnotetag5_78" id="footnotetag5_78" href="#footnote5_78"><sup>5</sup></a>festive<a href="#footnote5_78"><sup>5</sup></a> garments

comeliness appeared on him <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 68a.</span> and he made a crimson
wheel-ball of himself from his crown to the ground. <a name="footnotetag7_78" id="footnotetag7_78" href="#footnote7_78"><sup>7</sup></a>A

Seven toes he had to each of his two feet, and seven
fingers to each of his two hands, and seven pupils to
each of his two kingly eyes, and seven gems of the
brilliance of the eye was each separate pupil. Four
spots of down on either of his two cheeks: a blue spot, a
purple spot, a green spot, a yellow spot. Fifty strands of
bright-yellow hair from one ear to the other, like to a comb
of birch twigs or like to a brooch of pale gold in the face
of the sun. A clear, white, shorn spot was upon him, as
if a cow had licked it. A <a name="footnotetag10_78" id="footnotetag10_78" href="#footnote10_78"><sup>10</sup></a>fair, laced<a href="#footnote10_78"><sup>10</sup></a> green<a name="footnotetaga_78" id="footnotetaga_78" href="#footnotea_78"><sup>a</sup></a> mantle about

Two hard, five-pointed spears in his hand. A diadem of gold

feet of Conchobar, <a name="footnotetag14_78" id="footnotetag14_78" href="#footnote14_78"><sup>14</sup></a>and that was his couch ever after,<a href="#footnote14_78"><sup>14</sup></a> and

&quot;A mere lad accomplished these deeds at the end of

at whose hands two-thirds of the men of Ulster had fallen,
and these had not got their revenge on them until that
scion rose up for them. No need then is there of wonder
or of surprise, though he came to the border, though he
slew one man or two men or three men or four men, <a name="footnotetag2_79" id="footnotetag2_79" href="#footnote2_79"><sup>2</sup></a>though
he cut off the four-headed pole with one cut and one blow
of his shining sword<a href="#footnote2_79"><sup>2</sup></a> when now are fulfilled his seventeen

<p><a name="footnotetag3_79" id="footnotetag3_79" href="#footnote3_79"><sup>3</sup></a>Albeit gladness, joy and happiness was the part of the
men of Ulster for that, sorrow, grief and unhappiness was
the part of the men of Erin, for they knew that the little

it would be no wonder if he should do great deeds of valour
in the time of his manhood.<a href="#footnote3_79"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>These, accordingly, are some of the youthful exploits of
Cuchulain on the Raid for the Kine of Cualnge, and the

March of the Host up to this Point.</p>

<p>The Story proper is this which follows now.</p>

<p>&quot;Let us fare forth now,&quot; quoth Ailill. Thereafter they
reached Mag Mucceda ('the plain of the Swineherd.') Cuchulain
lopped off an oak that was before him in that place and
set an ogam-writing on its side. This is what was on it:
'That no one should pass by till a chariot-warrior with a
chariot should overleap it.'</p>

<p>They pitch there their tents and proceed to leap over
the oak in their chariots. Thereat thirty horses fall and
thirty chariots are broken. Now, Belach An&egrave; ('the Pass
of Sport') is the name of that place forever.</p>

<p>They bide there till morning. Fraech <a name="footnotetag2_80" id="footnotetag2_80" href="#footnote2_80"><sup>2</sup></a>son of Fidach<a href="#footnote2_80"><sup>2</sup></a>
was summoned to them. &quot;Help us, O Fraech,&quot; spake
Medb; &quot;deliver us from the strait we are in. Rise up for
us to meet Cuchulain, if perchance thou wilt fight him.&quot;</p>

<p>Betimes in the morning, with nine men Fraech went out
from thence till he arrived at Ath Fuait, when he saw the
youth Cuchulain bathing in the river. &quot;Bide here,&quot; spake
Fraech to his people, &quot;till I fight with yonder man; he is
not good in the water,&quot; said he. He doffs his clothes and
goes into the water to meet him. &quot;Come not before me,&quot;
cried Cuchulain; &quot;it shall be thy death and it would grieve
me to kill thee.&quot; &quot;Nay, but I will go,&quot; answered Fraech,
&quot;so that we come together in the water, and it behoves thee
to engage with me.&quot; &quot;Settle that as seemeth thee good,&quot;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_81" name="Page_81" title="81">81</a>
Cuchulain made answer. &quot;Each of us with his arms round
the other,&quot; said Fraech. They fall to wrestling for a long
time in the water and Fraech is thrust under. Cuchulain
brings him above again. &quot;This time,&quot; spake Cuchulain,
&quot;wilt thou acknowledge that I saved thee?&quot; &quot;I will
not,&quot; Fraech answered. Cuchulain thrusts him under again,
so that Fraech is destroyed. He is placed on the ground. His
people bear the body <a name="footnotetag10_81" id="footnotetag10_81" href="#footnote10_81"><sup>10</sup></a>with them<a href="#footnote10_81"><sup>10</sup></a> to the camp. Ath Fraeich

<h2>VIII. THE SLAYING OF ORLAM</h2>


<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 1393.</span>
The four grand provinces of Erin set forth on the morrow
eastwards over Cronn ('the Round'), which is a mountain.
Cuchulain had gone out before them, till he came upon the
charioteer of Orlam son of Aililla and of Medb. This was at
Tamlacht Orlaim ('Orlam's Gravestone') <a name="footnotetag1_82" id="footnotetag1_82" href="#footnote1_82"><sup>1</sup></a>a little to the<a href="#footnote1_82"><sup>1</sup></a> north
of Disert Lochaid ('Lochat's Hermitage'). The charioteer
was engaged in cutting chariot-poles from a holly-tree in
the wood. <a name="footnotetag2_82" id="footnotetag2_82" href="#footnote2_82"><sup>2</sup></a>But according to another version it is the
hind pole of Cuchulain's chariot that was broken and it
was to cut a pole he had gone when Orlam's charioteer came
up.<a href="#footnote2_82"><sup>2</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_82" id="footnotetag3_82" href="#footnote3_82"><sup>3</sup></a>According to this version, it was the charioteer who
was cutting the pole.<a href="#footnote3_82"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag4_82" id="footnotetag4_82" href="#footnote4_82"><sup>4</sup></a>Not long was the battle-victorious Hound there when
he heard a sound and an uproar.<a href="#footnote4_82"><sup>4</sup></a> &quot;Behold, O Laeg,&quot; cried
Cuchulain; &quot;<a name="footnotetag5_82" id="footnotetag5_82" href="#footnote5_82"><sup>5</sup></a>who of the host of the foe have come into this
land to carry off a share of cattle and booty from the province
wherein they came?<a href="#footnote5_82"><sup>5</sup></a> How bold are the ways of
the Ulstermen, if it be they that cut down the woods in this
fashion in the face of the men of Erin. But, <a name="footnotetag6_82" id="footnotetag6_82" href="#footnote6_82"><sup>6</sup></a>check the
horses and hold the chariot.<a href="#footnote6_82"><sup>6</sup></a> Tarry thou here a little, till I
know who cuts down the woods in this manner.&quot; Then
Cuchulain went on till he came up to <a name="footnotetag7_82" id="footnotetag7_82" href="#footnote7_82"><sup>7</sup></a>Orlam's<a href="#footnote7_82"><sup>7</sup></a> charioteer,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_83" name="Page_83" title="83">83</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1401.</span>
<a name="footnotetag1_83" id="footnotetag1_83" href="#footnote1_83"><sup>1</sup></a>to stop him; he thought he was one of the men of
Ulster.<a href="#footnote1_83"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;What dost thou here, gilla?&quot; asked Cuchulain.
&quot;Indeed, then,&quot; answered the gilla, &quot;I cut chariot-poles
from this holm, because our chariots were broken
yesterday in pursuit of that famous wildling, namely
Cuchulain. And for thy manhood's sake, young warrior,
pray come to my aid, so that that famous Cuchulain come
not upon me.&quot; &quot;Take thy choice, gilla,&quot; said Cuchulain,
&quot;to gather or to trim them, either.&quot; &quot;I will see to
gathering them, for it is easier,&quot; <a name="footnotetag2_83" id="footnotetag2_83" href="#footnote2_83"><sup>2</sup></a>the gilla answered.<a href="#footnote2_83"><sup>2</sup></a>
Cuchulain started to cut the poles and he drew them between
the forks of his feet and his hands against their bends
and their knots, so that he made them smooth and straight
and slippery and trimmed; he polished them so that not
even a midge could find footing thereon when he had
passed them away from him. Then full sure the gilla gazed
upon him. &quot;Far then, meseems, from fitting is the task
I put on thee. <a name="footnotetag3_83" id="footnotetag3_83" href="#footnote3_83"><sup>3</sup></a>And for love of thy valour,<a href="#footnote3_83"><sup>3</sup></a> who art
thou, say, O warrior?&quot; the gilla asked, <a name="footnotetag4_83" id="footnotetag4_83" href="#footnote4_83"><sup>4</sup></a>for he was sore
affrighted.<a href="#footnote4_83"><sup>4</sup></a> &quot;That same renowned Cuchulain am I of
whom thou spakest <a name="footnotetag5_83" id="footnotetag5_83" href="#footnote5_83"><sup>5</sup></a>a while ago<a href="#footnote5_83"><sup>5</sup></a> in the morning.&quot; &quot;Woe
is me then, by reason of this,&quot; cried the gilla; &quot;for this
am I lost forever.&quot; <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 68b.</span> <a name="footnotetag6_83" id="footnotetag6_83" href="#footnote6_83"><sup>6</sup></a>&quot;Whence comest thou <a name="footnotetag7_83" id="footnotetag7_83" href="#footnote7_83"><sup>7</sup></a>and who
art thou<a href="#footnote7_83"><sup>7</sup></a>?&quot; Cuchulain asked. &quot;Charioteer am I of Orlam,
Ailill's son and Medb's,&quot;<a href="#footnote6_83"><sup>6</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag8_83" id="footnotetag8_83" href="#footnote8_83"><sup>8</sup></a>said he.<a href="#footnote8_83"><sup>8</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag9_83" id="footnotetag9_83" href="#footnote9_83"><sup>9</sup></a>&quot;Fear nothing;<a href="#footnote9_83"><sup>9</sup></a> I
will not slay thee at all, boy,&quot; said Cuchulain; &quot;for I
slay nor charioteers nor horseboys nor persons unarmed.
But, prithee, where is thy master, <a name="footnotetag10_83" id="footnotetag10_83" href="#footnote10_83"><sup>10</sup></a>gilla<a href="#footnote10_83"><sup>10</sup></a>?&quot; &quot;Over yonder
by the trench, <a name="footnotetag11_83" id="footnotetag11_83" href="#footnote11_83"><sup>11</sup></a>with his back to the pillar-stone,<a href="#footnote11_83"><sup>11</sup></a>&quot;
answered the gilla. &quot;Off with thee thither to him and
bear him a warning that he be on his guard. For if we
meet he shall fall by my hand.&quot;</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_84" name="Page_84" title="84">84</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 1419.</span>
Thereupon the charioteer repaired <a name="footnotetag1_84" id="footnotetag1_84" href="#footnote1_84"><sup>1</sup></a>by one way<a href="#footnote1_84"><sup>1</sup></a> to his
master, <a name="footnotetag2_84" id="footnotetag2_84" href="#footnote2_84"><sup>2</sup></a>and Cuchulain went by another,<a href="#footnote2_84"><sup>2</sup></a> and fast as
the gilla sped to Orlam, faster still Cuchulain did reach
him <a name="footnotetag3_84" id="footnotetag3_84" href="#footnote3_84"><sup>3</sup></a>and offered him combat<a href="#footnote3_84"><sup>3</sup></a> and he struck off his
head, and raising it aloft displayed it to the men of
Erin, <a name="footnotetag4_84" id="footnotetag4_84" href="#footnote4_84"><sup>4</sup></a>and he flourished it in the presence of the host.<a href="#footnote4_84"><sup>4</sup></a>
<a name="footnotetag5_84" id="footnotetag5_84" href="#footnote5_84"><sup>5</sup></a>Then he put the head on the charioteer's back and
said, &quot;Take this with thee, and so go to the camp. Unless
thou goest so, a stone out of my sling will reach thee.&quot;</p>

<p>When the charioteer came nigh to the camp he took
the head from his back and told his adventures to Ailill
and Medb. &quot;It is not the same, this exploit and the catching
of birds,&quot; quoth she. &quot;And he told me&quot; (said the
boy), &quot;unless I brought it on my back to the camp, he would
break my head with a stone.&quot;<a href="#footnote5_84"><sup>5</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag6_84" id="footnotetag6_84" href="#footnote6_84"><sup>6</sup></a>Hence Leaca Orlaim
('Orlam's Flagstones') to the north of Disert Lochaid is the
name of the place where he fell. Tamlachta ('Gravestones')
is another name for it, and it is for this reason it
is so called because of the little gravestones and the violent
deaths which Cuchulain worked on it.&quot;<a href="#footnote6_84"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 1425.</span>
Then came the three macArach on to the ford at Ard
Ciannacht to encounter Cuchulain: Lon ('Ousel'), Uala
('Pride'), and Diliu ('Deluge');&mdash;Meslir ('Lir's Fosterling'),
and Meslaoc ('Hero's Fosterling'), and Meslethain ('Lethan's
Fosterling') were the names of their charioteers. This is
why they came to engage with Cuchulain, for the deed he
had done the day before they deemed past bearing, when
the two sons of Nera son of Nuatar, son of Tacan, were
slain at Ath Gabla ('Fork-ford'), and Orlam, Ailill's son and
Medb's, was slain withal and his head displayed to the men
of Erin, so that <a name="footnotetag2_85" id="footnotetag2_85" href="#footnote2_85"><sup>2</sup></a>their desire was<a href="#footnote2_85"><sup>2</sup></a> to kill Cuchulain in the
same manner <a name="footnotetag3_85" id="footnotetag3_85" href="#footnote3_85"><sup>3</sup></a>in revenge for him,<a href="#footnote3_85"><sup>3</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_85" id="footnotetag4_85" href="#footnote4_85"><sup>4</sup></a>and that they should
be the ones to rid the host of that pest<a href="#footnote4_85"><sup>4</sup></a> and bring his head
with them to set it aloft. They went into the wood and cut
off three <a name="footnotetag5_85" id="footnotetag5_85" href="#footnote5_85"><sup>5</sup></a>great<a href="#footnote5_85"><sup>5</sup></a> white-hazel wood-strips (and put them) into
the hands of their charioteers, so that the six of them might
engage in battle at one and the same time with Cuchulain.
Cuchulain turned on them and smote their six heads from
them. Thus fell the macArach at the hands of Cuchulain,
<a name="footnotetag6_85" id="footnotetag6_85" href="#footnote6_85"><sup>6</sup></a>because they observed not fair fight with him. At that
same time Orlam's charioteer was between Ailill and Medb.
Cuchulain slung a stone at him, so that it broke his head
and his brains came out over his ears. Fertedil was his
name. Hence it is not true that Cuchulain slew no charioteers.
Albeit he slew them not without fault.<a href="#footnote6_85"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 1439.</span>
There came also Lethan ('the Broad') to his ford on the Nith
in the land of Conalle Murthemni, to fight with Cuchulain.
<a name="footnotetag2_86" id="footnotetag2_86" href="#footnote2_86"><sup>2</sup></a>He was angered at what Cuchulain had wrought.<a href="#footnote2_86"><sup>2</sup></a> He came
upon him at the ford. Ath Carpait ('Chariot-ford') is the
name of the ford where they fought, for their chariots were
broken in the combat on the ford. It is there that Mulcha,
<a name="footnotetag3_86" id="footnotetag3_86" href="#footnote3_86"><sup>3</sup></a>Lethan's charioteer,<a href="#footnote3_86"><sup>3</sup></a> fell on the <a name="footnotetag4_86" id="footnotetag4_86" href="#footnote4_86"><sup>4</sup></a>shoulder of the<a href="#footnote4_86"><sup>4</sup></a> hill
between the two fords, <a name="footnotetag5_86" id="footnotetag5_86" href="#footnote5_86"><sup>5</sup></a>for he had offered battle and combat
to Laeg son of Riangabair.<a href="#footnote5_86"><sup>5</sup></a> Hence it is called Guala
Mulchi ('Mulcha's Shoulder') ever since. It is there, too, that
Cuchulain and Lethan met, and Lethan fell at Cuchulain's
hands and he smote his head from his neck on the ford and
left it therewith, that is, he left the head with the trunk.
Wherefore the name of the ford <a name="footnotetag6_86" id="footnotetag6_86" href="#footnote6_86"><sup>6</sup></a>of the Nith<a href="#footnote6_86"><sup>6</sup></a> was called
Ath Lethain ('Lethain's Ford') ever since in the district

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 1456.</span>
Then Cuchulain made a threat <a name="footnotetag2_88" id="footnotetag2_88" href="#footnote2_88"><sup>2</sup></a>in Meth&egrave;<a href="#footnote2_88"><sup>2</sup></a> that wherever
he saw Medb he would cast a stone at her and that it would
not go far from the side of her head. That he also fulfilled.
In the place where he saw Medb west of the ford he cast a
stone from his sling at her, so that it killed the pet bird
that was on her shoulder. Medb passed over the ford eastwards,
and again he cast a stone from his sling at her east of
the ford, so that it killed the tame squirrel that was on her
shoulder. Hence the names of those places are still, Meide
in Togmail ('Squirrel's Neck') and Meide ind Eoin ('Bird's
Neck'). And Ath Srethe ('Ford of the Throw') is the name
of the ford over which Cuchulain cast the stone from his
sling.</p>

Reuin. &quot;Your companion is not afar off from you,&quot; cried
Ailill to the Man&egrave;. They stood up and looked around.
When they sat down again, Cuchulain struck one of them
so that his head was split. &quot;It is well it was thou hast
essayed that; thy<a name="footnotetaga_88" id="footnotetaga_88" href="#footnotea_88"><sup>a</sup></a> mirth was not seemly,&quot; quoth Man&egrave;
the fool; &quot;it is I would have taken his head off.&quot; Cuchulain
flung a stone at him, so that his head was split. Thus
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_89" name="Page_89" title="89">89</a>
these people were slain: Orlam, first of all, on his hill;
the three sons of Arach<a name="footnotetaga_89" id="footnotetaga_89" href="#footnotea_89"><sup>a</sup></a> on their ford; Fertidil in his ... (?);
Maenan on his hill. &quot;I swear by the god by
whom my people swear,&quot; cried Ailill; &quot;the man that scoffs
at Cuchulain here I will make two halves of. But above
all let us hasten our way by day and by night,&quot; Ailill
continued, &quot;till we come to Cualnge. That man will slay
two-thirds of your host in this fashion.&quot;<a name="footnotetag3_89" id="footnotetag3_89" href="#footnote3_89"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag1_89" id="footnotetag1_89" href="#footnote1_89"><sup>1</sup></a>Then did the men of Erin deliberate about going to

came over his fosterer Fergus. And he bade the men

he threw off the thrice fifty boys who were wont to play on

was one of the magic virtues of the Brown Bull of Cualnge:
Fifty heifers he would cover every day. These calved before

they could not suffer the begetting of the Brown Bull of
Cualnge. One of the magic virtues of the Brown Bull of
Cualnge were the fifty <a name="footnotetag7_91" id="footnotetag7_91" href="#footnote7_91"><sup>7</sup></a>grown<a href="#footnote7_91"><sup>7</sup></a> youths who engaged in

of the Brown Bull of Cualnge was the hundred warriors

he screened from the heat and the cold under his shadow
and shelter. Another of the magic virtues of the Brown
Bull of Cualnge was that no goblin nor boggart nor sprite
of the glen dared come into one and the same cantred with
him. Another of the magic virtues of the Brown Bull of
Cualnge was his musical lowing every evening as he returned
to his haggard, his shed and his byre. It was music enough
and delight for a man in the north and in the south, <a name="footnotetag1_92" id="footnotetag1_92" href="#footnote1_92"><sup>1</sup></a>in the
east and the west,<a href="#footnote1_92"><sup>1</sup></a> and in the middle of the cantred of
Cualnge, the lowing he made at even as he came to his
haggard, his shed, and his byre. These, then, are some of
the magic virtues of the Brown Bull of Cualnge.</p>

<p>Thereupon on the morrow the hosts proceeded among
the rocks and dunes of the land of Conalle Murthemni.
<a name="footnotetag3_92" id="footnotetag3_92" href="#footnote3_92"><sup>3</sup></a>Cuchulain killed no one from Sail&egrave; ('the Sea') around
Dorth&egrave; in the land of Conalle, until he reached Cualnge.

He had threatened that, where he would see Medb,
he would hurl a stone at her head. It was not easy to do
this, for it was thus Medb went, with half the host around
her and their canopy of shields over her head.<a href="#footnote3_92"><sup>3</sup></a> And
Medb ordered a canopy of shields to be held over her head
in order that Cuchulain might not strike her from the hills
or hillocks or heights. Howbeit on that day, no killing
nor attack came from Cuchulain upon the men of Erin, in
the land of Murthemne among the rocks and dunes of

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 1552.</span>
The warriors of four of the five grand provinces of Erin
bided their time in Red&egrave; Loch&egrave; in Cualnge and pitched
camp and took quarters therein for that night. Medb
bade her fair handmaiden from amongst her attendants
to go for her to the river for water for drinking and washing.
Loch&egrave; was the name of the maiden. Thereupon Loch&egrave;
went, and fifty<a name="footnotetaga_93" id="footnotetaga_93" href="#footnotea_93"><sup>a</sup></a> women in her train and the queen's diadem
of gold on her head. And Cuchulain <a name="footnotetag2_93" id="footnotetag2_93" href="#footnote2_93"><sup>2</sup></a>espied them and
he<a href="#footnote2_93"><sup>2</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_93" id="footnotetag3_93" href="#footnote3_93"><sup>3</sup></a>put a stone on his sling and<a href="#footnote3_93"><sup>3</sup></a> cast <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 69b.</span> a stone from his

in three pieces and killed the maiden on her plain. Thence
is Red&egrave; Loch&egrave; ('the Plain of Loch&egrave;') in Cualnge. For
Cuchulain had thought, for want of acquaintance and
knowledge, that it was Medb that was there.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag5_93" id="footnotetag5_93" href="#footnote5_93"><sup>5</sup></a>From Finnabair of Cualnge the hosts divided and set
the country on fire. They gathered all their women and
boys and girls and cattle in Cualnge together so that they
all were in Finnabair. &quot;Ye have not fared well,&quot; quoth
Medb; &quot;I see not the bull amongst you.&quot; &quot;He is not
in the land at all,&quot; replied every one. They summoned
Lothar, the cowherd, to Medb. &quot;Where, thinkest thou,
is the bull?&quot; she asked. &quot;I have great fear to tell,&quot; said
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_94" name="Page_94" title="94">94</a>
the cowherd. &quot;The night,&quot; said he, &quot;that the Ulstermen
fell into their 'Pains,' the Donn went and three score
heifers along with him; and he is at Dubcaire Glinni Gat
('the Black Corrie of the Osier-glen').&quot; &quot;Rise,&quot; said
Medb, &quot;and take a withy between each two of you.&quot; And
they do accordingly. Hence is the name, Glenn Gatt, of
that glen.</p>

<p>Then they led the bull to Finnabair. In the place where
the bull saw Lothar, the cowherd, he attacked him, and
soon he carried his entrails out on his horns and together
with his thrice fifty heifers he attacked the camp, so that
fifty warriors perished. Hence this is the Tragical Death
of Lothar on the T&aacute;in <a name="footnotetag1_94" id="footnotetag1_94" href="#footnote1_94"><sup>1</sup></a>and the Finding of the Bull according
to this version.<a href="#footnote1_94"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_94" id="footnotetag2_94" href="#footnote2_94"><sup>2</sup></a>Thereafter the bull went from them
away from the camp and they knew not whither he had
gone from them and they were ashamed. Medb asked

the streams of the Cronn rose withal, until the hosts arrived
at Glaiss Cruinn ('Cronn's Stream').<a href="#footnote3_95"><sup>3</sup></a> And they attempted
the stream and failed to cross it <a name="footnotetag4_95" id="footnotetag4_95" href="#footnote4_95"><sup>4</sup></a>because of the size

<p>The warriors of the four grand provinces of Erin pitched
camp and took quarters that night at Belat Aileain ('the
Island's Crossway'). Belat Aileain was its name up to
then, but Glenn Tail ('Glen of Shedding') is henceforth
its name because of the abundance of curds and of milk
<a name="footnotetag5_97" id="footnotetag5_97" href="#footnote5_97"><sup>5</sup></a>and of new warm milk<a href="#footnote5_97"><sup>5</sup></a> which the droves of cattle and

it is for this it bears that name, for it is there that the men
of Erin raised cattle-stalls and byres for their herds and
droves <a name="footnotetag9_97" id="footnotetag9_97" href="#footnote9_97"><sup>9</sup></a>between Cualnge and Conalle.<a href="#footnote9_97"><sup>9</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag10_97" id="footnotetag10_97" href="#footnote10_97"><sup>10</sup></a>Botha is still

<p>The four of the five grand provinces of Erin took
up the march until they reached the Sechair <a name="footnotetag11_97" id="footnotetag11_97" href="#footnote11_97"><sup>11</sup></a>in the
west on the morrow.<a href="#footnote11_97"><sup>11</sup></a> Sechair was the name of the
river hitherto; Glaiss Gatlaig ('Osier-water') is its name
henceforward. <a name="footnotetag12_97" id="footnotetag12_97" href="#footnote12_97"><sup>12</sup></a>And Glaiss Gatlaig rose up against
them.<a href="#footnote12_97"><sup>12</sup></a> Now this is the reason it had that name, for it
was in osiers and ropes that the men of Erin brought
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_98" name="Page_98" title="98">98</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1599.</span>
their flocks and droves over across it, and the entire host
let their osiers and ropes drift with the stream after crossing.
Hence the name, Glaiss Gatlaig. <a name="footnotetag1_98" id="footnotetag1_98" href="#footnote1_98"><sup>1</sup></a>Then they slept at

<p><a name="footnotetag2_99" id="footnotetag2_99" href="#footnote2_99"><sup>2</sup></a>After every one had come with their spoils and they
were all gathered in Finnabair of Cualnge, Medb spake:
&quot;Let the camp be divided here,&quot; said Medb; &quot;the foray
cannot be caried on by a single road. Let Ailill with half
his force go by Midluachair. We and Fergus will go by
Bernas Bo Ulad ('the Pass of the Cattle of Ulster').&quot;
&quot;Not fair is the part that has fallen to us of the force,&quot;
said Fergus; &quot;the cattle cannot be driven over the mountain
without dividing.&quot; This then is done. Hence cometh
Bernas Bo Ulad ('the Pass of the Cattle of Ulster').</p>

<p>Then spake Ailill to his charioteer Cuillius: &quot;Find
out for me to-day Medb and Fergus. I wot not what hath
led them to keep thus together. I would fain have a token
from thee.&quot; Cuillius went where Medb and Fergus wantoned.
The pair dallied behind while the warriors continued
their march. Cuillius stole near them and they perceived
not the spy. It happened that Fergus' sword lay close by
him. Cuillius drew it from its sheath and left the sheath
empty. Then Cuillius betook himself to Ailill. &quot;Well?&quot;
said Ailill. &quot;Well, then,&quot; replied <a name="footnotetag3_99" id="footnotetag3_99" href="#footnote3_99"><sup>3</sup></a>Cuillius;<a href="#footnote3_99"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;thou
knowest the signification of this token. As thou hast
thought,&quot; continued Cuillius, &quot;it is thus I discovered them,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_100" name="Page_100" title="100">100</a>
lying together.&quot; &quot;It is so, then.&quot; Each of them laughs,
at the other. &quot;It is well so,&quot; said Ailill; &quot;she had no
choice; to win his help on the T&aacute;in she hath done it. Keep
the sword carefully by thee,&quot; said Ailill; &quot;put it beneath
thy seat in the chariot and a linen cloth wrapped round
it.&quot;</p>

<p>When Fergus got up to take his sword, &quot;Alas!&quot; cried
he. &quot;What aileth thee?&quot; Medb asked. &quot;An ill deed
have I done Ailill,&quot; said he. &quot;Wait thou here till I come
out of the wood,&quot; said Fergus, &quot;and wonder not though
it be long till I come.&quot; It happened that Medb knew not
of the loss of the sword. Fergus went out taking his
charioteer's sword with him in his hand, and he fashioned
a sword from a tree in the wood. Hence is Fid Mor Thruailli
('Great Scabbard-Wood') in Ulster.</p>

<p>&quot;Let us hasten after our comrades,&quot; said Fergus. The
forces of all came together in the plain. They raised their
tents. Fergus was summoned to Ailill for a game of chess.
When Fergus entered the tent Ailill laughed at him.<a name="footnotetaga_100" id="footnotetaga_100" href="#footnotea_100"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

<p>Cuchulain came so that he was before Ath Cruinn ('the
Ford of the Cronn'). &quot;O master Laeg,&quot; he cried to his
driver, &quot;here are the hosts for us.&quot; &quot;I swear by the
gods,&quot; said the charioteer, &quot;I will do a mighty feat in the
eyes of chariot-fighters, in quick spurring-on of the slender
steeds; with yokes of silver and golden wheels shall they
be urged on (?) in triumph. Thou shalt ride before heads
of kings. The steeds I guide will bring victory with their
bounding.&quot; &quot;Take heed, O Laeg,&quot; said Cuchulain; &quot;hold
the reins for the great triumph of Macha, that the horses
drag thee not over the mass at the ... (?) of a woman.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_101" name="Page_101" title="101">101</a>
Let us go over the straight plain of these ... (?). I
call on the waters to help me,&quot; cried Cuchulain. &quot;I beseech
heaven and earth and the Cronn above all.&quot;</p>

<p>Therewith the water rose up till it was in the tops of the
trees.</p>

<p>Man&egrave; son of Ailill and Medb marched in advance of
the rest. Cuchulain slew him on the ford and thirty horsemen
of his people were drowned. Again Cuchulain laid
low twice sixteen warriors of theirs near the stream. The
warriors of Erin pitched their tents near the ford. Lugaid
son of Nos <a name="footnotetag1_101" id="footnotetag1_101" href="#footnote1_101"><sup>1</sup></a>grandson of Lomarc<a href="#footnote1_101"><sup>1</sup></a> Allcomach went to
parley with Cuchulain. Thirty horsemen were with him.
&quot;Welcome to thee, O Lugaid,&quot; cried Cuchulain. &quot;Should
a flock of birds graze upon the plain of Murthemne, thou
shalt have a wild goose with half the other. Should fish come
to the falls or to the bays, thou shalt have a salmon with
as much again. Thou shalt have the three sprigs, even a
sprig of cresses, a sprig of laver, and a sprig of sea-grass;
there will be a man to take thy place at the ford.&quot; &quot;This
welcome is truly meant,&quot; replied Lugaid; &quot;the choice of
people for the youth whom I desire!&quot; &quot;Splendid are your
hosts,&quot; said Cuchulain. &quot;It will be no misfortune,&quot; said
Lugaid, &quot;for thee to stand up alone before them.&quot; &quot;True
courage and valour have I,&quot; Cuchulain made answer.
&quot;Lugaid, my master,&quot; said Cuchulain, &quot;do the hosts fear
me?&quot; &quot;By the god,&quot; Lugaid made answer, &quot;I swear that
no one man of them nor two men dares make water outside
the camp unless twenty or thirty go with him.&quot; &quot;It will
be something for them,&quot; said Cuchulain, &quot;if I begin to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_102" name="Page_102" title="102">102</a>
cast from my sling. He will be fit for thee, O Lugaid, this
companion thou hast in Ulster, <a name="footnotetag1_102" id="footnotetag1_102" href="#footnote1_102"><sup>1</sup></a>if the men oppose me one
by one.<a href="#footnote1_102"><sup>1</sup></a> Say, then, what wouldst thou?&quot; asked Cuchulain.
&quot;A truce with my host.&quot; &quot;Thou shalt have it,
provided there be a token therefor. And tell my master
Fergus that there shall be a token on the host. Tell the
leeches that there shall be a token on the host, and let
them swear to preserve my life and let them provide me
each night with provision.&quot;</p>

<p>Lugaid went from him. It happened that Fergus was
in the tent with Ailill. Lugaid called him out and reported
that (proposal of Cuchulain's) to him. Then Ailill was
heard:<a name="footnotetaga_102" id="footnotetaga_102" href="#footnotea_102"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;I swear by the god, I cannot,&quot; said <a name="footnotetag3_102" id="footnotetag3_102" href="#footnote3_102"><sup>3</sup></a>Fergus,<a href="#footnote3_102"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;unless I
ask the lad. Help me, O Lugaid,&quot; said Fergus. &quot;Do thou go
to him, to see whether Ailill with a division may come to me
to my company. Take him an ox with salt pork and a keg
of wine.&quot; Thereupon Lugaid goes to Cuchulain and tells
him that. &quot;'Tis the same to me whether he go,&quot; said
Cuchulain. Then the two hosts unite. They remain there till
night, <a name="footnotetag4_102" id="footnotetag4_102" href="#footnote4_102"><sup>4</sup></a>or until they spend thirty nights there.<a href="#footnote4_102"><sup>4</sup></a> Cuchulain
destroyed thirty of their warriors with his sling. &quot;Your
journeyings will be ill-starred,&quot; said Fergus (to Medb and
Ailill); &quot;the men of Ulster will come out of their 'Pains'
and will grind you down to the earth and the gravel. Evil
is the battle-corner wherein we are.&quot; He proceeds to
Cul Airthir ('the Eastern Nook'). Cuchulain slays thirty
of their heroes on Ath Duirn ('Ford of the Fist'). Now
they could not reach Cul Airthir till night. Cuchulain killed
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_103" name="Page_103" title="103">103</a>
thirty of their men there and they raised their tents in that
place. In the morning Ailill's charioteer, Cuillius to wit,
was washing the wheel-bands in the ford. Cuchulain struck
him with a stone so that he killed him. Hence is Ath
Cuillne ('Ford of Destruction') in Cul Airthir.'<a name="footnotetag2_103" id="footnotetag2_103" href="#footnote2_103"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

The four grand provinces of Erin proceeded till they pitched
camp and took quarters in Druim En ('Birds' Ridge') in
the land of Conalle Murthemni, <a name="footnotetag1_104" id="footnotetag1_104" href="#footnote1_104"><sup>1</sup></a>and they slept there<a href="#footnote1_104"><sup>1</sup></a>
that night, <a name="footnotetag2_104" id="footnotetag2_104" href="#footnote2_104"><sup>2</sup></a>as we said before,<a href="#footnote2_104"><sup>2</sup></a> and Cuchulain held himself
at Ferta Illergaib ('the Burial-mound on the Slopes') hard
by them that night, and he, Cuchulain, shook, brandished
and flourished his weapons that night. <a name="footnotetag3_104" id="footnotetag3_104" href="#footnote3_104"><sup>3</sup></a>Every night of
the three nights they were there he made casts from his
sling at them, from Ochaine nearby,<a href="#footnote3_104"><sup>3</sup></a> so that one hundred
warriors of the host perished of fright and fear and dread
of Cuchulain. <a name="footnotetag4_104" id="footnotetag4_104" href="#footnote4_104"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;Not long will our host endure in this
way with Cuchulain,&quot; quoth Ailill.<a href="#footnote4_104"><sup>4</sup></a> Medb called upon
Fiachu son of Ferfeb&egrave; of the Ulstermen to go parley with
Cuchulain, to come to some terms with him. &quot;What
terms shall be given him?&quot; asked Fiachu son of Ferfeb&egrave;.
&quot;Not hard to answer,&quot; Medb replied: &quot;He shall be recompensed
<a name="footnotetag5_104" id="footnotetag5_104" href="#footnote5_104"><sup>5</sup></a>for the loss of his lands and estates,<a href="#footnote5_104"><sup>5</sup></a> for whosoever
has been slain of the Ulstermen, so that it be paid to him
as the men of Erin adjudge <a name="footnotetag6_104" id="footnotetag6_104" href="#footnote6_104"><sup>6</sup></a>according to the will of
the Ulstermen and of Fergus and of the nobles of the men
of Erin who are in this camp and encampment.<a href="#footnote6_104"><sup>6</sup></a> Entertainment
shall be his at all times in Cruachan; wine and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_105" name="Page_105" title="105">105</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1614.</span>

was reared and thrice seven bondmaids.<a href="#footnote1_105"><sup>1</sup></a> And he shall
come into my service and Ailill's, for that is more seemly for
him than to be in the service of the lordling with whom he

<p>Accordingly this was the greatest word of scorn and
insult spoken on the Cow-Raid of Cualnge, to make a
lordling of the best king of a province in Erin, even of Conchobar.</p>

<p>Then came Fiachu son of Ferfeb&egrave; to converse with
Cuchulain. Cuchulain bade him welcome. &quot;<a name="footnotetag3_105" id="footnotetag3_105" href="#footnote3_105"><sup>3</sup></a>Welcome

&quot;I regard that welcome as truly meant,&quot; <a name="footnotetag4_105" id="footnotetag4_105" href="#footnote4_105"><sup>4</sup></a>said Fiachu.<a href="#footnote4_105"><sup>4</sup></a>

thou shalt have a night of hospitality this night.&quot; &quot;Victory
and a blessing attend thee, O fosterling,&quot; replied
Fiachu. &quot;Not for hospitality am I come, but<a href="#footnote6_105"><sup>6</sup></a> to
parley with thee am I come from Medb, <a name="footnotetag7_105" id="footnotetag7_105" href="#footnote7_105"><sup>7</sup></a>and to
bring thee terms.&quot;<a href="#footnote7_105"><sup>7</sup></a> &quot;What hast thou brought with
thee?&quot; &quot;Thou shalt be recompensed for whatsoever was
destroyed of Ulster which shall be paid thee as best the
men of Erin adjudge. Entertainment shalt thou enjoy in
Cruachan; wine and mead shall be poured out for thee
and thou shalt enter the service of Ailill and Medb, for that
is more seemly for thee than to be in the service of the
lordling with whom thou art.&quot; &quot;Nay, of a truth,&quot; answered
Cuchulain, &quot;I would not sell my mother's brother<a name="footnotetaga_105" id="footnotetaga_105" href="#footnotea_105"><sup>a</sup></a> for
any other king!&quot; &quot;Further,&quot; <a name="footnotetag8_105" id="footnotetag8_105" href="#footnote8_105"><sup>8</sup></a>continued Fiachu,<a href="#footnote8_105"><sup>8</sup></a> &quot;that

thou comest to-morrow to a tryst with Medb and Fergus
in Glenn Fochaine.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag1_106" id="footnotetag1_106" href="#footnote1_106"><sup>1</sup></a>Therewith Fiachu left behind a wish for long life and
health with Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote1_106"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Accordingly, early on the morrow, Cuchulain set forth
for Glenn Fochaine. Likewise Medb and Fergus went to
meet him. And Medb looked narrowly at Cuchulain, and
her spirit chafed her at him that day, for no bigger than the
bulk of a stripling did he seem to her. &quot;Is that yonder
the renowned Cuchulain thou speakest of, O Fergus?&quot;
asked Medb, <a name="footnotetag2_106" id="footnotetag2_106" href="#footnote2_106"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;of whom it is said amongst ye Ulstermen
that there is not in Erin a warrior for whom he is not a
match and mighty combat?&quot; &quot;Not in Erin alone, did
we say,&quot; Fergus made answer; &quot;but there is not in the
world a warrior for whom he is not a match and mighty
combat.&quot;<a href="#footnote2_106"><sup>2</sup></a> And Medb began to address Fergus and she
made this lay:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>&quot;Accost Cuchulain, O Fergus,&quot; said Medb. &quot;Nay, then,&quot;
quoth Fergus, &quot;but do thou accost him thyself, for ye
are not asunder here in the valley, in Glenn Fochaine.&quot;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_107" name="Page_107" title="107">107</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1653.</span>
And Medb began to address Cuchulain and she made a lay,
<a name="footnotetag1_107" id="footnotetag1_107" href="#footnote1_107"><sup>1</sup></a>to which he responded:<a href="#footnote1_107"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p>When this lay was finished, Cuchulain accepted none
of the terms which she had offered. In such wise they
parted in the valley and withdrew in equal anger on the
one side and on the other.</p>

<p>The warriors of four of the five grand provinces of Erin
pitched camp and took quarters for three days and three
nights at Druim En ('Birds' Ridge') in Conalle Murthemni,
but neither huts nor tents did they set up, nor did they
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_108" name="Page_108" title="108">108</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1688.</span>
engage in feasts or repasts, nor sang they songs nor carols
those three nights. And Cuchulain destroyed a hundred
of their warriors every night ere the bright hour of sunrise
on the morrow.</p>

<p><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 70b.</span> &quot;Our hosts will not last long in this fashion,&quot; said
Medb, &quot;if Cuchulain slays a hundred of our warriors every
night. Wherefore is a proposal not made to him and do
we not parley with him?&quot; &quot;What might the proposal be?&quot;
asked Ailill. &quot;Let the cattle that have milk be given to
him and the captive women from amongst our booty.
And he on his side shall check his staff-sling from the men
of Erin and give leave to the hosts to sleep, <a name="footnotetag1_108" id="footnotetag1_108" href="#footnote1_108"><sup>1</sup></a>even though
he slay them by day.&quot;<a href="#footnote1_108"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;Who shall go with that proposal?&quot;
Ailill asked. &quot;Who,&quot; answered Medb, &quot;but
macRoth the <a name="footnotetag2_108" id="footnotetag2_108" href="#footnote2_108"><sup>2</sup></a>chief<a href="#footnote2_108"><sup>2</sup></a> runner!&quot; &quot;Nay, but I will not go,&quot;
said macRoth, &quot;for I am in no way experienced and
know not where Cuchulain may be, <a name="footnotetag3_108" id="footnotetag3_108" href="#footnote3_108"><sup>3</sup></a>and even though I
should meet him, I should not know him.<a href="#footnote3_108"><sup>3</sup></a>&quot; &quot;Ask Fergus,&quot;
quoth Medb; &quot;like enough he knows <a name="footnotetag4_108" id="footnotetag4_108" href="#footnote4_108"><sup>4</sup></a>where he
is.<a href="#footnote4_108"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot; &quot;Nay, then, I know it not,&quot; answered Fergus;
&quot;but I trow he is <a name="footnotetag5_108" id="footnotetag5_108" href="#footnote5_108"><sup>5</sup></a>in the snow<a href="#footnote5_108"><sup>5</sup></a> between Fochain and
the sea, taking the wind and the sun after his sleeplessness
last night, killing and slaughtering the host single handed.&quot;
And so it truly was. <a name="footnotetag6_108" id="footnotetag6_108" href="#footnote6_108"><sup>6</sup></a>Then on that errand to Delga macRoth
set forth, the messenger of Ailill and Medb. He it
is that circles Erin in one day. There it is that Fergus
opined that Cuchulain would be, in Delga.<a href="#footnote6_108"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Heavy snow fell that night so that all the <a name="footnotetag7_108" id="footnotetag7_108" href="#footnote7_108"><sup>7</sup></a>five<a href="#footnote7_108"><sup>7</sup></a> provinces
of Erin were a white plane with the snow. And
Cuchulain doffed the seven-score waxed, boardlike tunics
which were used to be held under cords and strings next his
skin, in order that his sense might not be deranged when
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_109" name="Page_109" title="109">109</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1709.</span>
the fit of his fury came on him. And the snow melted for
thirty feet all around him, because of the intensity of the
warrior's heat and the warmth of Cuchulain's body. And
the gilla <a name="footnotetag1_109" id="footnotetag1_109" href="#footnote1_109"><sup>1</sup></a>remained a good distance from him for he<a href="#footnote1_109"><sup>1</sup></a>
could not endure to remain near him because of the might
of his rage and the warrior's fury and the heat of his body.
&quot;A single warrior approacheth, O Cuchulain,&quot; cried Laeg
<a name="footnotetag2_109" id="footnotetag2_109" href="#footnote2_109"><sup>2</sup></a>to Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote2_109"><sup>2</sup></a> &quot;What manner of warrior is he?&quot; asked
Cuchulain. &quot;A brown, broad-faced, handsome fellow;
<a name="footnotetag3_109" id="footnotetag3_109" href="#footnote3_109"><sup>3</sup></a>a yellow head of hair and a linen ornament round it<a href="#footnote3_109"><sup>3</sup></a>;
a splendid, brown, <a name="footnotetag4_109" id="footnotetag4_109" href="#footnote4_109"><sup>4</sup></a>hooded<a href="#footnote4_109"><sup>4</sup></a> cloak, <a name="footnotetag5_109" id="footnotetag5_109" href="#footnote5_109"><sup>5</sup></a>with red ornamentation,<a href="#footnote5_109"><sup>5</sup></a>
about him; a fine, bronze pin in his cloak; a leathern
three-striped doublet next his skin; two gapped shoes
between his two feet and the ground; a white-hazel dog-staff
in one of his hands; a single-edged sword with ornaments
of walrus-tooth on its hilt in the other. &quot;Good, O
gilla,&quot; quoth Cuchulain, &quot;these be the tokens of a herald.
One of the heralds of Erin is he to bring me message and
offer of parley.&quot;</p>

<p>Now was macRoth arrived at the place where Laeg was,
&quot;<a name="footnotetag6_109" id="footnotetag6_109" href="#footnote6_109"><sup>6</sup></a>How now<a href="#footnote6_109"><sup>6</sup></a>! What is thy title as vassal, O gilla? &quot;macRoth
asked. &quot;Vassal am I to the youth up yonder,&quot; the gilla
made answer. MacRoth came to the place where Cuchulain
was. <a name="footnotetag7_109" id="footnotetag7_109" href="#footnote7_109"><sup>7</sup></a>Cuchulain was sitting in the snow there up to his
two hips with nothing about him ... his mantle.<a href="#footnote7_109"><sup>7</sup></a> &quot;<a name="footnotetag8_109" id="footnotetag8_109" href="#footnote8_109"><sup>8</sup></a>How
now<a href="#footnote8_109"><sup>8</sup></a>! What is thy name as vassal, O warrior?&quot; asked macRoth.
&quot;Vassal am I to Conchobar son of Fachtna Fathach,
<a name="footnotetag9_109" id="footnotetag9_109" href="#footnote9_109"><sup>9</sup></a>son of the High King of this province.&quot;<a href="#footnote9_109"><sup>9</sup></a> &quot;Hast not something,
<a name="footnotetag10_109" id="footnotetag10_109" href="#footnote10_109"><sup>10</sup></a>a name<a href="#footnote10_109"><sup>10</sup></a> more special than that?&quot; &quot;Tis enough
for the nonce,&quot; answered Cuchulain. &quot;Haply, thou knowest
where I might find that famous Cuchulain of whom the men
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_110" name="Page_110" title="110">110</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1729.</span>
of Erin clamour now on this foray?&quot; &quot;What wouldst thou
say to him that thou wouldst not to me?&quot; asked Cuchulain.
&quot;To parley with him am I come on the part of Ailill and
Medb, with terms and friendly intercourse for him.&quot; &quot;What
terms hast thou brought with thee for him?&quot; &quot;The
milch-kine and the bondwomen of the booty he shall have,
and for him to hold back his staff-sling from the hosts,
for not pleasant is the thunder-feat he works every evening
upon them.&quot; &quot;Even though the one thou seekest were
really at hand, he would not accept the proposals thou
askest.&quot; &quot;<a name="footnotetag1_110" id="footnotetag1_110" href="#footnote1_110"><sup>1</sup></a>How so, then,&quot; said macRoth<a href="#footnote1_110"><sup>1</sup></a>; &quot;for the
Ulstermen, as amends for their honour and in reprisal
for injuries and satires and hindrances <a name="footnotetag2_110" id="footnotetag2_110" href="#footnote2_110"><sup>2</sup></a>and for bands
of troops and marauders,<a href="#footnote2_110"><sup>2</sup></a> will kill <a name="footnotetag3_110" id="footnotetag3_110" href="#footnote3_110"><sup>3</sup></a>for meat in the
winter<a href="#footnote3_110"><sup>3</sup></a> the milch-cows ye have captured, should they
happen to have no yeld cattle. And, what is more, they
will bring their bondwomen to bed to them, and thus will
grow up a base progeny on the side of the mothers in the
land of Ulster, <a name="footnotetag4_110" id="footnotetag4_110" href="#footnote4_110"><sup>4</sup></a>and loath I am to leave after me such a
disgrace on the men of Ulster.<a href="#footnote4_110"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>MacRoth went his way back <a name="footnotetag5_110" id="footnotetag5_110" href="#footnote5_110"><sup>5</sup></a>to the camp of the men of
Erin to where Ailill and Medb and Fergus were.<a href="#footnote5_110"><sup>5</sup></a> &quot;What!
Didst thou not find him?&quot; Medb asked. &quot;Verily, <a name="footnotetag6_110" id="footnotetag6_110" href="#footnote6_110"><sup>6</sup></a>I
know not, but<a href="#footnote6_110"><sup>6</sup></a> I found a surly, angry, hateful, wrathful
gilla <a name="footnotetag7_110" id="footnotetag7_110" href="#footnote7_110"><sup>7</sup></a>in the snow<a href="#footnote7_110"><sup>7</sup></a> betwixt Fochain and the sea. Sooth
to say, I know not if he were Cuchulain.&quot; &quot;Hath he accepted
these proposals <a name="footnotetag8_110" id="footnotetag8_110" href="#footnote8_110"><sup>8</sup></a>from thee?&quot;<a href="#footnote8_110"><sup>8</sup></a> &quot;Nay then, he
hath not.&quot; And macRoth related <a name="footnotetag9_110" id="footnotetag9_110" href="#footnote9_110"><sup>9</sup></a>unto them all his
answer,<a href="#footnote9_110"><sup>9</sup></a> the reason why he did not accept them. &quot;It was
he himself with whom thou spakest,&quot; said Fergus.</p>

<p>&quot;Another offer shall be made him,&quot; said Medb. &quot;What
is the offer?&quot; asked Ailill. &quot;There shall be given to him
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_111" name="Page_111" title="111">111</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1747.</span>
the yeld cattle and the noblest of the captive women of the
booty, and his sling shall be checked from the hosts, for
not pleasant is the thunder-feat he works on them every
evening.&quot; &quot;Who should go make this covenant?&quot; <a name="footnotetag1_111" id="footnotetag1_111" href="#footnote1_111"><sup>1</sup></a>said
they.<a href="#footnote1_111"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;Who but macRoth <a name="footnotetag2_111" id="footnotetag2_111" href="#footnote2_111"><sup>2</sup></a>the king's envoy,&quot;<a href="#footnote2_111"><sup>2</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_111" id="footnotetag3_111" href="#footnote3_111"><sup>3</sup></a>said

the men of Erin to go to sleep, for not pleasant is the thunder-feat
thou workest upon them every evening.&quot; &quot;I accept
not that offer, because, as amends for their honour, the
Ulstermen will kill the dry cattle. For the men of Ulster
are honourable men and they would remain wholly without
dry kine and milch-kine. They would bring their free
women ye have captured to the querns and to the kneading-troughs
and into bondage and <a name="footnotetag9_111" id="footnotetag9_111" href="#footnote9_111"><sup>9</sup></a>other<a href="#footnote9_111"><sup>9</sup></a> serfdom <a name="footnotetag10_111" id="footnotetag10_111" href="#footnote10_111"><sup>10</sup></a>besides.<a href="#footnote10_111"><sup>10</sup></a>

asked macRoth. &quot;By my word,&quot; Cuchulain made answer,
&quot;'tis not I that will tell you.&quot; &quot;It is a question, then,&quot;
said macRoth. &quot;If there be among you in the camp,&quot;
said Cuchulain, &quot;one that knows the terms I demand, let

<p>MacRoth came back <a name="footnotetag4_112" id="footnotetag4_112" href="#footnote4_112"><sup>4</sup></a>to the camp and station of the
men of Erin, to where Ailill, Medb, and Fergus were,<a href="#footnote4_112"><sup>4</sup></a>

&quot;is there an offer he will accept?&quot; &quot;There is one, he
said,&quot; <a name="footnotetag7_112" id="footnotetag7_112" href="#footnote7_112"><sup>7</sup></a>answered macRoth.<a href="#footnote7_112"><sup>7</sup></a> &quot;Hath he made known to

&quot;should there be one in our midst that knows his

<a name="footnotetag8_112" id="footnotetag8_112" href="#footnote8_112"><sup>8</sup></a>said Ailill. &quot;And if there be not,&quot;<a href="#footnote8_112"><sup>8</sup></a> (answered macRoth),

what are those terms?&quot; asked Medb. &quot;<a name="footnotetag16_112" id="footnotetag16_112" href="#footnote16_112"><sup>16</sup></a>Not difficult
to say,&quot; replied Fergus.<a href="#footnote16_112"><sup>16</sup></a> &quot;That a single champion of

the men of Erin <a name="footnotetag1_113" id="footnotetag1_113" href="#footnote1_113"><sup>1</sup></a>be sent<a href="#footnote1_113"><sup>1</sup></a> to fight <a name="footnotetag2_113" id="footnotetag2_113" href="#footnote2_113"><sup>2</sup></a>and contend<a href="#footnote2_113"><sup>2</sup></a> with
him every day. The while he slayeth that man, the army
will be permitted to continue its march. Then, when he
will have slain that man, another warrior shall be sent to
meet him on the ford. Either that, or the men of Erin
shall halt and camp there till sunrise's bright hour in the
morning. <a name="footnotetag3_113" id="footnotetag3_113" href="#footnote3_113"><sup>3</sup></a>And, by the ford whereon his single-handed
battle and fight takes place, the cattle shall not be taken
by day or by night, to see if there come to him help from
the men of Ulster. And I wonder,&quot; continued Fergus,
&quot;how long it will be till they come out of their 'Pains.'<a href="#footnote3_113"><sup>3</sup></a>
<a name="footnotetag4_113" id="footnotetag4_113" href="#footnote4_113"><sup>4</sup></a>Whatever Ulstermen are injured or wounded nearby him,
your leeches shall heal them and ye shall not be paid for
the price of their healing. Whatever daughter of kings
or of princes of the men of Erin shall love him, ye shall
bring her to him together with her purchase and bride-price.<a href="#footnote4_113"><sup>4</sup></a>
And further, Cuchulain's food and clothing shall be provided
by you, <a name="footnotetag5_113" id="footnotetag5_113" href="#footnote5_113"><sup>5</sup></a>so long as he will be<a href="#footnote5_113"><sup>5</sup></a> on this expedition.&quot;
<a name="footnotetag6_113" id="footnotetag6_113" href="#footnote6_113"><sup>6</sup></a>&quot;Good, O Fergus,&quot;<a href="#footnote6_113"><sup>6</sup></a> asked Ailill,<a name="footnotetaga_113" id="footnotetaga_113" href="#footnotea_113"><sup>a</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag7_113" id="footnotetag7_113" href="#footnote7_113"><sup>7</sup></a>&quot;will he abate aught
of these terms?&quot; &quot;In sooth, will he,&quot; replied Fergus;
&quot;namely, he will not exact to be fed and clothed by you,
but of himself will provide food and clothing.&quot;<a href="#footnote7_113"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;By our conscience,&quot; said Ailill, &quot;this is a grievous proposal.&quot;
&quot;What he asks is good,&quot; replied Medb; &quot;and he
shall obtain those terms, for we deem it easier to bear that
he should have one of our warriors every day than a hundred
every night.&quot; &quot;Who will go and make known those terms
to Cuchulain?&quot; &quot;Who, then, but Fergus?&quot; replied
Medb. &quot;<a name="footnotetag8_113" id="footnotetag8_113" href="#footnote8_113"><sup>8</sup></a>Come now, O Fergus,&quot; said Medb; &quot;take upon
thee to fulfil and make good those terms to him.&quot;<a href="#footnote8_113"><sup>8</sup></a>

Fergus' horses were brought and his chariot was hitched
<a name="footnotetag2_115" id="footnotetag2_115" href="#footnote2_115"><sup>2</sup></a>and Fergus set forth on that errand.<a href="#footnote2_115"><sup>2</sup></a> And two horses

&quot;I am, to be sure,&quot; Fergus answered, &quot;provided thou thyself

<p>Then they went their ways <a name="footnotetag3_116" id="footnotetag3_116" href="#footnote3_116"><sup>3</sup></a>in two chariots to Delga,<a href="#footnote3_116"><sup>3</sup></a>

<p>&quot;Holla! Welcome the coming of this guest to us!&quot;
cried Cuchulain. &quot;We know the man; it is my master
Fergus that cometh hither. <a name="footnotetag7_117" id="footnotetag7_117" href="#footnote7_117"><sup>7</sup></a>Empty is the great paddle
that my master Fergus carries,&quot; said Cuchulain; &quot;for
there is no sword in its sheath but a sword of wood. For
I have heard,&quot; Cuchulain continued, &quot;that Ailill got a
chance at him and Medb as they lay, and he took away
Fergus' sword from him and gave it to his charioteer to
take care of, and the sword of wood was put into its sheath.&quot;<a href="#footnote7_117"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Yet another single chariot-fighter I see coming towards
us. With fulness of skill and beauty and splendour his
horses speed.&quot; <a name="footnotetag8_117" id="footnotetag8_117" href="#footnote8_117"><sup>8</sup></a>&quot;A young, tender gilla in armour is in the
chariot.<a href="#footnote8_117"><sup>8</sup></a>&quot; &quot;One of the youths of the men of Erin is he, O
my master Laeg,&quot; responded Cuchulain. &quot;To scan my
appearance and form is that man come, for I am renowned
amongst them in the midst of their camp, <a name="footnotetag9_117" id="footnotetag9_117" href="#footnote9_117"><sup>9</sup></a>and they know
me not at all.&quot;<a href="#footnote9_117"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

Fergus responded. &quot;Verily, it is truly meant for thee,&quot;
said Cuchulain; &quot;for comes there a brace of birds into

&quot;Well, then, <a name="footnotetag9_118" id="footnotetag9_118" href="#footnote9_118"><sup>9</sup></a>mayest thou have victory and blessing, O
fosterling,&quot; said Fergus.<a href="#footnote9_118"><sup>9</sup></a> &quot;We know of what sort is thy
hospitality on this occasion, on the Cow-spoil of Cualnge.
<a name="footnotetag10_118" id="footnotetag10_118" href="#footnote10_118"><sup>10</sup></a>But, not to claim that are we come,<a href="#footnote10_118"><sup>10</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag11_118" id="footnotetag11_118" href="#footnote11_118"><sup>11</sup></a>a night's hospitality

the men of Erin, single-handed combat with one man,
thou shalt have it. It is for that I am come, to bind
thee thereto, and do thou take it upon thee.&quot; &quot;I pledge
myself truly,&quot; said Cuchulain, <a name="footnotetag13_118" id="footnotetag13_118" href="#footnote13_118"><sup>13</sup></a>provided fair play and
single-handed combat be granted to me.<a href="#footnote13_118"><sup>13</sup></a> &quot;And, O, my

And no longer than that did he remain in parley, lest the
men of Erin should say they were betrayed or deserted
by Fergus for his disciple. Fergus' two horses were
brought and his chariot was harnessed and he went
back.</p>

<p>Etarcumul tarried behind gazing for a long time at
Cuchulain. &quot;At what starest thou, gilla?&quot; asked
Cuchulain. &quot;I look at thee,&quot; said Etarcumul. &quot;In

<p>The charioteer wheeled the chariot again towards the

<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1871.</span>
ford. They brought the left<a name="footnotetaga_121" id="footnotetaga_121" href="#footnotea_121"><sup>a</sup></a> board to face the pair in a
line with the ford. Laeg marked <a name="footnotetag1_121" id="footnotetag1_121" href="#footnote1_121"><sup>1</sup></a>this and he cried<a href="#footnote1_121"><sup>1</sup></a>
<a name="footnotetag2_121" id="footnotetag2_121" href="#footnote2_121"><sup>2</sup></a>to Cuchulain<a href="#footnote2_121"><sup>2</sup></a>: (&quot;Wist thou) the last chariot-fighter
that was here a while ago, O Cucuc?&quot; &quot;What of him?&quot;
asked Cuchulain. &quot;He has brought his left board towards
us in the direction of the ford.&quot; &quot;It is Etarcumul, O gilla,
who seeks me in combat. <a name="footnotetag3_121" id="footnotetag3_121" href="#footnote3_121"><sup>3</sup></a>I owe no refusal,<a href="#footnote3_121"><sup>3</sup></a> but far
from pleased am I thereat <a name="footnotetag4_121" id="footnotetag4_121" href="#footnote4_121"><sup>4</sup></a>that he should come and seek
combat of me. And unwelcome is his coming,<a href="#footnote4_121"><sup>4</sup></a> because
of the honour of my foster-father <a name="footnotetag5_121" id="footnotetag5_121" href="#footnote5_121"><sup>5</sup></a>Fergus<a href="#footnote5_121"><sup>5</sup></a> under whom
he came forth from the camp <a name="footnotetag6_121" id="footnotetag6_121" href="#footnote6_121"><sup>6</sup></a>of the men of Erin.<a href="#footnote6_121"><sup>6</sup></a> But
not that I would protect him do I thus. Fetch me my
arms, gilla, to the ford. <a name="footnotetag7_121" id="footnotetag7_121" href="#footnote7_121"><sup>7</sup></a>Bring me my horse and my
chariot after me.<a href="#footnote7_121"><sup>7</sup></a> I deem it no honour for myself if
<a name="footnotetag8_121" id="footnotetag8_121" href="#footnote8_121"><sup>8</sup></a>the fellow<a href="#footnote8_121"><sup>8</sup></a> reaches the ford before me.&quot; And straightway
Cuchulain betook himself to the ford, and he bared
his sword over his fair, well-knit spalls and he was ready
on the ford to await Etarcumul.</p>

<p>Then, too, came Etarcumul. &quot;What seekest thou,
gilla?&quot; demanded Cuchulain. &quot;Battle with thee I seek,&quot;
replied Etarcumul. &quot;Hadst thou been advised by me,&quot;
said Cuchulain, &quot;thou wouldst never have come. <a name="footnotetag9_121" id="footnotetag9_121" href="#footnote9_121"><sup>9</sup></a>I
do not desire what thou demandest of me.<a href="#footnote9_121"><sup>9</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag10_121" id="footnotetag10_121" href="#footnote10_121"><sup>10</sup></a>I have no
thought of fighting or contending with thee, Etarcumul.<a href="#footnote10_121"><sup>10</sup></a>
Because of the honour of Fergus under whom thou
camest out of the camp <a name="footnotetag11_121" id="footnotetag11_121" href="#footnote11_121"><sup>11</sup></a>and station of the men of Erin,<a href="#footnote11_121"><sup>11</sup></a>
and not because I would spare thee, do I behave thus.&quot;
<a name="footnotetag12_121" id="footnotetag12_121" href="#footnote12_121"><sup>12</sup></a>&quot;Thou hast no choice but to fight,&quot; replied Etarcumul.<a href="#footnote12_121"><sup>12</sup></a>
Thereupon Cuchulain gave him a long-blow whereby
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_122" name="Page_122" title="122">122</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1886.</span>
he cut away the sod that was under the soles of his
feet, so that he was stretched out like a sack on his
back, and <a name="footnotetag1_122" id="footnotetag1_122" href="#footnote1_122"><sup>1</sup></a>his limbs in the air<a href="#footnote1_122"><sup>1</sup></a> and the sod on his belly.
Had Cuchulain wished it it is two pieces he might have
made of him. <a name="footnotetag2_122" id="footnotetag2_122" href="#footnote2_122"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;Hold, fellow.<a href="#footnote2_122"><sup>2</sup></a> Off with thee now, for
I have given thee warning. <a name="footnotetag3_122" id="footnotetag3_122" href="#footnote3_122"><sup>3</sup></a>It mislikes me to cleanse
my hands in thee. I would have cloven thee into many
parts long since but for Fergus.&quot;<a href="#footnote3_122"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;I will not go. We
will fight on,&quot; said Etarcumul. Cuchulain dealt him a
well-aimed edge-stroke. <a name="footnotetag4_122" id="footnotetag4_122" href="#footnote4_122"><sup>4</sup></a>With the edge of his sword<a href="#footnote4_122"><sup>4</sup></a>
he sheared the hair from him from poll to forehead, from
one ear to the other, as if it were with a light, keen razor
he had been shorn. <a name="footnotetag5_122" id="footnotetag5_122" href="#footnote5_122"><sup>5</sup></a>Not a scratch of his skin gave blood.<a href="#footnote5_122"><sup>5</sup></a>
<a name="footnotetag6_122" id="footnotetag6_122" href="#footnote6_122"><sup>6</sup></a>&quot;Hold, fellow.<a href="#footnote6_122"><sup>6</sup></a> Get thee home now,&quot; said Cuchulain,
&quot;for a laughing-stock I have made of thee.&quot; &quot;I go not,&quot;
<a name="footnotetag7_122" id="footnotetag7_122" href="#footnote7_122"><sup>7</sup></a>rejoined Etarcumul.<a href="#footnote7_122"><sup>7</sup></a> &quot;We will fight to the end, till I
take thy head and thy spoils and boast over thee, or till
thou takest my head and my spoils and boastest over me!&quot;
&quot;So let it be, what thou saidst last, that it shall be. I
will take thy head and thy spoils and boast over thee!&quot;
<a name="footnotetag8_122" id="footnotetag8_122" href="#footnote8_122"><sup>8</sup></a>When now the churl became troublesome and persistent,<a href="#footnote8_122"><sup>8</sup></a>
Cuchulain <a name="footnotetag9_122" id="footnotetag9_122" href="#footnote9_122"><sup>9</sup></a>sprang from the ground, so that he alighted on
the edge of Etarcumul's shield, and he<a href="#footnote9_122"><sup>9</sup></a> dealt him a cleaving-blow
on the crown of the head, so that it drove to his
navel. He dealt him a second crosswise stroke, so that at
the one time the three portions of his body came to the
ground. Thus fell Etarcumul son of Fid and of Lethrinn.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag10_122" id="footnotetag10_122" href="#footnote10_122"><sup>10</sup></a>Then Etarcumul's charioteer went his way after Fergus,<a href="#footnote10_122"><sup>10</sup></a>
and Fergus knew not that the combat had been. For
thus was his wont: <a name="footnotetag11_122" id="footnotetag11_122" href="#footnote11_122"><sup>11</sup></a>From the day Fergus took warrior's
arms in hand,<a href="#footnote11_122"><sup>11</sup></a> he never for aught looked back, whether at
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_123" name="Page_123" title="123">123</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1904.</span>
sitting or at rising or when travelling or walking, in battle
or fight or combat, lest some one might say it was out of
fear he looked back, but ever he looked at the thing that
was before and beside him. <a name="footnotetag1_123" id="footnotetag1_123" href="#footnote1_123"><sup>1</sup></a>Fergus saw the chariot go
past him and a single man in it.<a href="#footnote1_123"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_123" id="footnotetag2_123" href="#footnote2_123"><sup>2</sup></a>And when<a href="#footnote2_123"><sup>2</sup></a> Etarcumul's
squire came up abreast of Fergus, Fergus asked, &quot;But,
where is thy lord, gilla?&quot; &quot;He fell a while since at the
ford by the hand of Cuchulain,&quot; the gilla made answer.
&quot;That indeed was not fair!&quot; exclaimed Fergus, &quot;for that
elf-like sprite to wrong me in him that came under my safeguard
<a name="footnotetag3_123" id="footnotetag3_123" href="#footnote3_123"><sup>3</sup></a>and protection<a href="#footnote3_123"><sup>3</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_123" id="footnotetag4_123" href="#footnote4_123"><sup>4</sup></a>from the camp and fort of the
men of Erin.<a href="#footnote4_123"><sup>4</sup></a> Turn the chariot for us, gilla,&quot; cried Fergus,
&quot;that we may go to <a name="footnotetag5_123" id="footnotetag5_123" href="#footnote5_123"><sup>5</sup></a>the ford of fight and combat<a href="#footnote5_123"><sup>5</sup></a> for
a parley with Cuchulain.&quot;</p>

<p>Thereupon the driver wheeled the chariot. They fared
thither towards the ford. <a name="footnotetag6_123" id="footnotetag6_123" href="#footnote6_123"><sup>6</sup></a>Fergus turned to rebuke
Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote6_123"><sup>6</sup></a> &quot;How darest thou offend me, thou wild,
<a name="footnotetag7_123" id="footnotetag7_123" href="#footnote7_123"><sup>7</sup></a>perverse, little<a href="#footnote7_123"><sup>7</sup></a> elf-man,&quot; cried Fergus, &quot;in him that

and care thou didst bestow on me <a name="footnotetag10_123" id="footnotetag10_123" href="#footnote10_123"><sup>10</sup></a>and the Ulstermen
bestowed and Conchobar<a href="#footnote10_123"><sup>10</sup></a> tell me, which wouldst thou
hold better, <a name="footnotetag11_123" id="footnotetag11_123" href="#footnote11_123"><sup>11</sup></a>for the Ulstermen to be conquered without
anyone to punish them but me alone and<a href="#footnote11_123"><sup>11</sup></a> for him
to triumph and boast over me, or for me to triumph and
boast over him? And yet more, <a name="footnotetag12_123" id="footnotetag12_123" href="#footnote12_123"><sup>12</sup></a>of his own fault he
fell.<a href="#footnote12_123"><sup>12</sup></a> Ask his own gilla which of us was in fault in
respect of the other; <a name="footnotetag13_123" id="footnotetag13_123" href="#footnote13_123"><sup>13</sup></a>it was none other but he.<a href="#footnote13_123"><sup>13</sup></a><a name="footnotetaga_123" id="footnotetaga_123" href="#footnotea_123"><sup>a</sup></a>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_124" name="Page_124" title="124">124</a>
<a name="footnotetag1_124" id="footnotetag1_124" href="#footnote1_124"><sup>1</sup></a>Reproach me not, O Fergus my master.&quot; He bent
down so that Fergus' chariot went past him thrice.
&quot;Ask his charioteer, is it I that have caused it?&quot; &quot;Not
thou indeed,&quot; answered his charioteer. &quot;He said,&quot; Cuchulain
went on, &quot;he would not go till either he took my head
or he left me his own.&quot;<a href="#footnote1_124"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_124" id="footnotetag2_124" href="#footnote2_124"><sup>2</sup></a>Then Etarcumul's gilla related
to Fergus how it all befel. When Fergus heard that, what
he said was:<a href="#footnote2_124"><sup>2</sup></a> <span class="sidenoteL">W. 1921.</span> &quot;Liefer to me what thou hast done,
<a name="footnotetag3_124" id="footnotetag3_124" href="#footnote3_124"><sup>3</sup></a>O fosterling,&quot; said Fergus, &quot;that Etarcumul is slain, and<a href="#footnote3_124"><sup>3</sup></a> a
blessing on the hand that smote him, <a name="footnotetag4_124" id="footnotetag4_124" href="#footnote4_124"><sup>4</sup></a>for it is he that was
overweening.&quot;<a href="#footnote4_124"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>So then they bound two spancels about the ankle-joints
of Etarcumul's feet and he was dragged along behind his
horses and chariot. At every rock that was rough for him,
his lungs and his liver were left on the stones and the rugged
places. At every place that was smooth for him, his skilfully
severed limbs came together again round the horses.
In this wise he was dragged through the camp to the door
of the tent of Ailill and Medb: &quot;There's your young warrior
for you,&quot; cried Fergus, &quot;for 'Every restoration together
with its restitution' is what the law saith.&quot;<a name="footnotetaga_124" id="footnotetaga_124" href="#footnotea_124"><sup>a</sup></a> Medb
came forth to the door of her tent and she raised her <a name="footnotetag5_124" id="footnotetag5_124" href="#footnote5_124"><sup>5</sup></a>quick,

for a tender youth that falls on thee now.<a href="#footnote8_124"><sup>8</sup></a> We had thought
that the honour under which he went, even the honour of

crazed the virago and wench?&quot; cried Fergus. &quot;Good lack,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_125" name="Page_125" title="125">125</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1935.</span>
is it fitting for the mongrel to seek the Hound of battle
whom <a name="footnotetag1_125" id="footnotetag1_125" href="#footnote1_125"><sup>1</sup></a>the warriors and champions<a href="#footnote1_125"><sup>1</sup></a> of four of the five
grand provinces of Erin dare not approach nor withstand?
What, I myself was glad to escape whole from him!&quot;</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag2_125" id="footnotetag2_125" href="#footnote2_125"><sup>2</sup></a>Etarcumul's grave was then dug and his tombstone
erected; his name was written in ogam and they raised the

that night<a href="#footnote2_125"><sup>2</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_125" id="footnotetag3_125" href="#footnote3_125"><sup>3</sup></a>and the women and maidens were brought

to him by day.<a href="#footnote3_125"><sup>3</sup></a> In this manner fell Etarcumul and such
was the combat of Etarcumul with Cuchulain.</p>

tell him their message. &quot;Come with us for the sake of the
honour of Connacht.&quot; &quot;I will not go,&quot; said he, &quot;unless
they give Finnabair to me.&quot; Afterwards he goes with
them. They bring his armour in a car from the east of
Connacht and place it in the camp.<a href="#footnote4_126"><sup>4</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag5_126" id="footnotetag5_126" href="#footnote5_126"><sup>5</sup></a>Then was Nathcrantail
called into the tent of Ailill and Medb.<a href="#footnote5_126"><sup>5</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag6_126" id="footnotetag6_126" href="#footnote6_126"><sup>6</sup></a>&quot;Wherefore

am I summoned to ye?&quot; Nathcrantail asked. &quot;It
would please us well,&quot; Medb replied, &quot;werest thou to fight
and contend with Cuchulain on the ford and ward him off
from us at the morning hour early on the morrow.<a name="footnotetag6_127" id="footnotetag6_127" href="#footnote6_127"><sup>6</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag1_127" id="footnotetag1_127" href="#footnote1_127"><sup>1</sup></a>Thou
shalt have Finnabair,&quot; said Medb, &quot;for going to fight yonder

undertake the battle and combat and that night be made

the battle and combat and he took his warlike implements
with him to the fight, and though early he arose, Cuchulain
arose still earlier.<a href="#footnote2_127"><sup>2</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_127" id="footnotetag3_127" href="#footnote3_127"><sup>3</sup></a>That night Lugaid came to Cuchulain.
&quot;Nathcrantail comes to meet thee to-morrow. Alas for

Cuchulain made answer.<a href="#footnote3_127"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="footnotetaga_127" id="footnotetaga_127" href="#footnotea_127"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag4_127" id="footnotetag4_127" href="#footnote4_127"><sup>4</sup></a>On the morrow Nathcrantail went forth from the camp<a href="#footnote4_127"><sup>4</sup></a>
and he came to attack Cuchulain. <span class="sidenoteL">W. 1942.</span> He did not deign to
bring along arms but thrice nine spits of holly after being
sharpened, burnt and hardened in fire. And there before
him on the pond was Cuchulain <a name="footnotetag5_127" id="footnotetag5_127" href="#footnote5_127"><sup>5</sup></a>a-fowling and his chariot
hard by him,<a href="#footnote5_127"><sup>5</sup></a><a name="footnotetagb_127" id="footnotetagb_127" href="#footnoteb_127"><sup>b</sup></a> and there was no shelter whatever. <a href="#footnote6_127"><sup>6</sup></a>And
when Nathcrantail perceived Cuchulain<a href="#footnote6_127"><sup>6</sup></a> he <a name="footnotetag7_127" id="footnotetag7_127" href="#footnote7_127"><sup>7</sup></a>straightway<a href="#footnote7_127"><sup>7</sup></a>
cast a dart at Cuchulain. Cuchulain sprang <a name="footnotetag8_127" id="footnotetag8_127" href="#footnote8_127"><sup>8</sup></a>from the
middle of the ground<a href="#footnote8_127"><sup>8</sup></a> till he came on the tip of the dart.
<a name="footnotetag9_127" id="footnotetag9_127" href="#footnote9_127"><sup>9</sup></a>And he performed a feat on the point of the dart and it
hindered him not from catching the birds.<a href="#footnote9_127"><sup>9</sup></a> And again
Nathcrantail threw a second dart. Nathcrantail threw a
third dart and Cuchulain sprang on the point of the second

<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1951.</span>
dart and so on till he was on the point of the last dart.
It was then, <a name="footnotetag1_128" id="footnotetag1_128" href="#footnote1_128"><sup>1</sup></a>when Nathcrantail threw the ninth dart,<a href="#footnote1_128"><sup>1</sup></a>
that the flock of birds <a name="footnotetag2_128" id="footnotetag2_128" href="#footnote2_128"><sup>2</sup></a>which Cuchulain pursued<a href="#footnote2_128"><sup>2</sup></a> on the
plain <a name="footnotetag3_128" id="footnotetag3_128" href="#footnote3_128"><sup>3</sup></a>flew away from Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote3_128"><sup>3</sup></a> Cuchulain chased
them even as any bird <a name="footnotetag4_128" id="footnotetag4_128" href="#footnote4_128"><sup>4</sup></a>of the air.<a href="#footnote4_128"><sup>4</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag5_128" id="footnotetag5_128" href="#footnote5_128"><sup>5</sup></a>He hopped on the
points of the darts like a bird from each dart to the next,
pursuing the birds<a href="#footnote5_128"><sup>5</sup></a> that they might not escape him but
that they might leave behind a portion of food for the
night. For this is what sustained and served Cuchulain,
fish and fowl and game on the Cualnge Cow-spoil. Something
more remains to be told: Nathcrantail deemed full
surely that Cuchulain went from him in rout of defeat
and flight. And he went his way till he came to the door
of the tent of Ailill and Medb and he lifted up his loud
voice <a name="footnotetag6_128" id="footnotetag6_128" href="#footnote6_128"><sup>6</sup></a>of a warrior<a href="#footnote6_128"><sup>6</sup></a>: &quot;That famous Cuchulain that ye
so talk of ran and fled in defeat <a name="footnotetag7_128" id="footnotetag7_128" href="#footnote7_128"><sup>7</sup></a>before me when he came
to me<a href="#footnote7_128"><sup>7</sup></a> in the morning.&quot; &quot;We knew,&quot; spake Medb, &quot;it
would be even so when able warriors and goodly youths
met him, that this beardless imp would not hold out; for
when a mighty warrior, <a name="footnotetag8_128" id="footnotetag8_128" href="#footnote8_128"><sup>8</sup></a>Nathcrantail to wit,<a href="#footnote8_128"><sup>8</sup></a> came upon
him, he withstood him not but before him he ran away!&quot;</p>

<p>And Fergus heard that, and Fergus <a name="footnotetag9_128" id="footnotetag9_128" href="#footnote9_128"><sup>9</sup></a>and the Ulstermen<a href="#footnote9_128"><sup>9</sup></a>
were sore angered that any one should boast that Cuchulain
had fled. And Fergus addressed himself to Fiachu,
Feraba's son, that he should go to rebuke Cuchulain. &quot;And
tell <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 73a.</span> him it is an honour for him to oppose the hosts for
as long or as short a space as he does deeds of valour upon
them, but that it were fitter for him to hide himself than
to fly before any one of their warriors, <a name="footnotetag10_128" id="footnotetag10_128" href="#footnote10_128"><sup>10</sup></a>forasmuch as the
dishonour would be not greater for him than for the rest of
Ulster.&quot;<a href="#footnote10_128"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_129" name="Page_129" title="129">129</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 1969.</span>
Thereupon Fiachu went to address Cuchulain. Cuchulain
bade him welcome. &quot;I trow that welcome to be truly
meant, but it is for counsel with thee I am come from thy
fosterer Fergus. And he has said, 'It would be a glory
for thee to oppose the hosts for as long or as short a space
as thou doest valiantly <a name="footnotetag1_129" id="footnotetag1_129" href="#footnote1_129"><sup>1</sup></a>with them;<a href="#footnote1_129"><sup>1</sup></a> but it would be
fitter for thee to hide thyself than to fly before any one of
their warriors!'&quot; &quot;How now, who makes that boast
among ye?&quot; Cuchulain asked. &quot;Nathcrantail, of a
surety,&quot; Fiachu answered. &quot;How may this be? Dost
not know, thou and Fergus and the nobles of Ulster, that
I slay no charioteers nor heralds nor unarmed people?
And he bore no arms but a spit of wood. And I would
not slay Nathcrantail until he had arms. And do thou tell
him, let him come here early in the morning, <a name="footnotetag2_129" id="footnotetag2_129" href="#footnote2_129"><sup>2</sup></a>till he is between
Ochain&egrave; and the sea, and however early he comes,
he will find me here<a href="#footnote2_129"><sup>2</sup></a> and I will not fly before him!&quot;</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag3_129" id="footnotetag3_129" href="#footnote3_129"><sup>3</sup></a>Fiachu went back to the camp<a href="#footnote3_129"><sup>3</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_129" id="footnotetag4_129" href="#footnote4_129"><sup>4</sup></a>and to the station
of the men of Erin, and he bound Nathcrantail to go to
the ford of combat on the morrow. They bided there that
night,<a href="#footnote4_129"><sup>4</sup></a> and it seemed long to Nathcrantail till day with its
light came for him to attack Cuchulain. He set out early
on the morrow to attack Cuchulain. Cuchulain arose early
<a name="footnotetag5_129" id="footnotetag5_129" href="#footnote5_129"><sup>5</sup></a>and came to his place of meeting<a href="#footnote5_129"><sup>5</sup></a> and his wrath bided
with him on that day. And <a name="footnotetag6_129" id="footnotetag6_129" href="#footnote6_129"><sup>6</sup></a>after his night's vigil,<a href="#footnote6_129"><sup>6</sup></a> with
an angry cast he threw his cloak around him, so that it
passed over the pillar-stone <a name="footnotetag7_129" id="footnotetag7_129" href="#footnote7_129"><sup>7</sup></a>near by, the size of himself,<a href="#footnote7_129"><sup>7</sup></a>
and snapped the pillar-stone off from the ground between
himself and his cloak. And he was aware of naught because
of the measure of anger that had come on and raged
in him. Then, too, came Nathcrantail. <a name="footnotetag8_129" id="footnotetag8_129" href="#footnote8_129"><sup>8</sup></a>His arms were
brought with him on a wagon,<a href="#footnote8_129"><sup>8</sup></a> and he spake, &quot;Where is
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_130" name="Page_130" title="130">130</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 1987.</span>
this Cuchulain?&quot; shouted Nathcrantail. &quot;Why, over
yonder <a name="footnotetag1_130" id="footnotetag1_130" href="#footnote1_130"><sup>1</sup></a>near the pillar-stone before thee,&quot;<a href="#footnote1_130"><sup>1</sup></a> answered
Cormac Conlongas son of Conchobar. &quot;Not such was the
shape wherein he appeared to me yesterday,&quot; said Nathcrantail.
&quot;Repel yon warrior,&quot; quoth Cormac, &quot;and it
will be the same for thee as if thou repellest Cuchulain!&quot;
<a name="footnotetag2_130" id="footnotetag2_130" href="#footnote2_130"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;Art thou Cuchulain?&quot; &quot;And if I am?&quot; answered
Cuchulain. &quot;If thou be truly he,&quot; said Nathcrantail, &quot;I
would not bring a lambkin's head to the camp. I will not
take thy head, the head of a beardless boy.&quot; &quot;It is not
I at all,&quot; said Cuchulain; &quot;go find him around the hill!&quot;
Cuchulain hastens to Laeg. &quot;Rub a false beard on me;
I cannot get the warrior to fight with me beardless.&quot; This
was done for him. He goes to meet Nathcrantail on the hill.
&quot;Methinks that more fitting. Now fight with me
fairly,&quot; said Nathcrantail. &quot;Thou shalt have thy wish,
if only we know it,&quot; Cuchulain made answer. &quot;I will
make a cast at thee,&quot; said Nathcrantail, &quot;and thou shalt
not avoid it.&quot; &quot;I will not avoid it except on high,&quot;
said Cuchulain. Nathcrantail makes a cast at him.
Cuchulain springs on high before it. &quot;'Tis ill of thee
to avoid the cast,&quot; cried Nathcrantail. &quot;Avoid then my
cast on high!&quot; quoth Cuchulain. Cuchulain lets the
spear fly at him and it went on high, so that from above
it alighted on Nathcrantail's crown and through him it
went to the ground. &quot;Alas,&quot; said he, &quot;the best warrior
in Erin art thou,&quot; spake Nathcrantail. &quot;Four and twenty
sons have I in the camp. I will go and tell them what
hidden treasure I have and then return for thee to behead
me, for I shall die if the spear be taken out of my head.&quot;
&quot;It is well,&quot; quoth Cuchulain; &quot;thou shalt come back.&quot;
Then Nathcrantail returns to the camp. They all come
to meet him. &quot;Where is the madman's head with thee?&quot;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_131" name="Page_131" title="131">131</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 1992.</span>
Soon came Nathcrantail <a name="footnotetag3_131" id="footnotetag3_131" href="#footnote3_131"><sup>3</sup></a>to seek Cuchulain<a href="#footnote3_131"><sup>3</sup></a> and he
made a wide sweep with his sword at Cuchulain. <a name="footnotetag4_131" id="footnotetag4_131" href="#footnote4_131"><sup>4</sup></a>Cuchulain
leaps on high,<a href="#footnote4_131"><sup>4</sup></a> so that the sword encountered the pillar
of stone that was between Cuchulain and his cloak, and
the sword broke <a name="footnotetag5_131" id="footnotetag5_131" href="#footnote5_131"><sup>5</sup></a>atwain<a href="#footnote5_131"><sup>5</sup></a> on the pillar-stone. <a name="footnotetag6_131" id="footnotetag6_131" href="#footnote6_131"><sup>6</sup></a>Then
Cuchulain became filled with rage, as he had been with the
boys in Emain, and<a href="#footnote6_131"><sup>6</sup></a> he sprang from the ground and
alighted on the top of the boss of Nathcrantail's shield and
dealt him a side stroke over the upper edge of the shield,
so that he struck off his head from his trunk. He raised
his hand quickly again and gave him another blow on the
top of the trunk so that he cleft him in twain down to the
ground. <a name="footnotetag7_131" id="footnotetag7_131" href="#footnote7_131"><sup>7</sup></a>His four severed parts fell to the ground.<a href="#footnote7_131"><sup>7</sup></a>
Thus fell Nathcrantail slain by Cuchulain. Whereupon
Cuchulain spoke <a name="footnotetag8_131" id="footnotetag8_131" href="#footnote8_131"><sup>8</sup></a>the verse:&mdash;<a href="#footnote8_131"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

that Cuchulain turned back from the north <a name="footnotetag1_133" id="footnotetag1_133" href="#footnote1_133"><sup>1</sup></a>to Mag Murthemni,<a href="#footnote1_133"><sup>1</sup></a>

the two sons of Durcride, the two sons of Gabul, and Drucht
and Delt and Dathen, Tae and Tualang and Turscur, and
Torc Glaisse and Glass and Glassne, which are the same
as the twenty men of Fochard. Cuchulain surprised them

<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2031.</span>
with them, as far as the ford. Then it was he spoke to the
leader<a name="footnotetag11_134" id="footnotetag11_134" href="#footnote11_133"><sup>11</sup></a>, &quot;What is thine own name?&quot; said Cuchulain.
&quot;One that neither loves thee nor fears thee,&quot; Buide made

of Ailill and Medb.&quot; <a name="footnotetag1_134" id="footnotetag1_134" href="#footnote1_134"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;Wella-day, O Buide,&quot; cried Cuchulain;
&quot;haste to the ford below that we exchange a couple
of throws with each other.&quot; They came to the ford and
exchanged a couple of throws there.<a href="#footnote1_134"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;Lo, here for thee
this short spear,&quot; said Cuchulain, and he casts the spear
at him. It struck the shield over his belly, so that it shattered
three ribs in his farther side after piercing his heart
in his bosom. And Buide son of Ban Blai fell <a name="footnotetag2_134" id="footnotetag2_134" href="#footnote2_134"><sup>2</sup></a>on the

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 2061.</span>
When the men of Erin had come together in one place,
both Medb and Ailill and the force that was bringing the
bull to the camp and enclosure, they all declared Cuchulain
would be no more valiant than another <a name="footnotetag2_137" id="footnotetag2_137" href="#footnote2_137"><sup>2</sup></a>of the men of
Erin<a href="#footnote2_137"><sup>2</sup></a> were it not for the wonderful little trick he possessed,
the spearlet of Cuchulain. Accordingly the men of Erin
despatched from them Redg, Medb's<a name="footnotetaga_137" id="footnotetaga_137" href="#footnotea_137"><sup>a</sup></a> jester, to demand
the light javelin <a name="footnotetag3_137" id="footnotetag3_137" href="#footnote3_137"><sup>3</sup></a>of Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote3_137"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>So Redg <a name="footnotetag4_137" id="footnotetag4_137" href="#footnote4_137"><sup>4</sup></a>came forward to where Cuchulain was and<a href="#footnote4_137"><sup>4</sup></a>
asked for the little javelin, but Cuchulain did not give
him the little javelin <a name="footnotetag5_137" id="footnotetag5_137" href="#footnote5_137"><sup>5</sup></a>at once<a href="#footnote5_137"><sup>5</sup></a>; he did not deem it good
and proper to yield it. <a name="footnotetag6_137" id="footnotetag6_137" href="#footnote6_137"><sup>6</sup></a>&quot;Give me thy spear,&quot; said the
jester. &quot;Nay then, I will not,&quot; answered Cuchulain; &quot;but
I will give thee treasure.&quot; &quot;I will not take it,&quot; said the
jester. Then he wounded the jester because he would not
accept from him what he had offered him.<a href="#footnote6_137"><sup>6</sup></a> Redg declared
he would deprive Cuchulain of his honour <a name="footnotetag7_137" id="footnotetag7_137" href="#footnote7_137"><sup>7</sup></a>unless he got
the little javelin.<a href="#footnote7_137"><sup>7</sup></a> Thereupon Cuchulain hurled the javelin
at him, so that it struck him in the nape of the neck<a name="footnotetagb_137" id="footnotetagb_137" href="#footnoteb_137"><sup>b</sup></a> and
fell out through his mouth on the ground. And the only
words Redg uttered were these, &quot;This precious gift is readily
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_138" name="Page_138" title="138">138</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2072.</span>
ours,&quot; and his soul separated from his body at the ford.
Therefrom that ford is ever since called Ath Solom Shet
('Ford of the Ready Treasure'). And the copper of the
javelin was thrown into the river. Hence is Uman-Sruth
('Copperstream') ever after.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag1_138" id="footnotetag1_138" href="#footnote1_138"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;Let us ask for a sword-truce from Cuchulain,&quot; says
Ailill. &quot;Let Lugaid go to him,&quot; one and all answer.
Then Lugaid goes to parley with him. &quot;How now do I
stand with the host?&quot; Cuchulain asks. &quot;Disgraceful
indeed is the thing thou hast demanded of them,&quot; Lugaid
answers, &quot;even this, that thou shouldst have thy women
and maidens and half of thy kine. But more grievous than
all do they hold it that they themselves should be killed
and thou provisioned.&quot;</p>

<p>Every day there fell a man by Cuchulain till the end of a
week. <a name="footnotetag2_138" id="footnotetag2_138" href="#footnote2_138"><sup>2</sup></a>Then<a href="#footnote2_138"><sup>2</sup></a> faith is broken with Cuchulain. Twenty are
despatched at one time to attack him and he destroys them
all. &quot;Go to him, O Fergus,&quot; says Ailill, &quot;that he may
vouchsafe us a change of place.&quot; A while after this they
proceed to Cronech. These are they that fell in single combat
with him in that place, to wit: the two Roth, the two
Luan, two women-thieves, ten fools, ten cup-bearers, the
ten Fergus, the six Fedelm, the six Fiachu. Now these
were all killed by him in single combat.</p>

<p>When their tents were pitched by them in Cronech they
discussed what they had best do with Cuchulain. &quot;I
know,&quot; quoth Medb, &quot;what is best here. Let some one
go to him from us for a sword-pact from him in respect of
the host, and he shall have half the cattle that are here.&quot;
This message they bring to him. &quot;I will do it,&quot; said
Cuchulain, &quot;provided the bond is not broken by you<a href="#footnote1_138"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_138" id="footnotetag3_138" href="#footnote3_138"><sup>3</sup></a>to-morrow.<a href="#footnote3_138"><sup>3</sup></a>&quot;</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag2_139" id="footnotetag2_139" href="#footnote2_139"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;Let a message be sent to him,&quot; said Ailill, &quot;that Finnabair
my daughter will be bestowed on him, and for him
to keep away from the hosts.&quot; Man&egrave; Athramail ('Fatherlike')
goes to him. But first he addresses himself to Laeg.
&quot;Whose man art thou?&quot; spake Man&egrave;. Now Laeg made
no answer. Thrice Man&egrave; addressed him in this <a name="footnotetag3_139" id="footnotetag3_139" href="#footnote3_139"><sup>3</sup></a>same<a href="#footnote3_139"><sup>3</sup></a> wise.
&quot;Cuchulain's man,&quot; Laeg answers, &quot;and provoke me not,
lest it happen I strike thy head off thee!&quot; &quot;This man is
mad,&quot; quoth Man&egrave; as he leaves him. Then he goes to
accost Cuchulain. It was there Cuchulain had doffed his
tunic, and the <a name="footnotetag4_139" id="footnotetag4_139" href="#footnote4_139"><sup>4</sup></a>deep<a href="#footnote4_139"><sup>4</sup></a> snow was around him where he sat, up
to his belt, and the snow had melted a cubit around him for
the greatness of the heat of the hero. And Man&egrave; addressed
him three times in like manner, whose man he was?
&quot;Conchobar's man, and do not provoke me. For if thou
provokest me any longer I will strike thy head off thee as
one strikes off the head of a blackbird!&quot; &quot;No easy thing,&quot;
quoth Man&egrave;, &quot;to speak to these two.&quot; Thereupon Man&egrave;
leaves them and tells his tale to Ailill and Medb.</p>

<p>&quot;Let Lugaid go to him,&quot; said Ailill, &quot;and offer him the
girl.&quot; Thereupon Lugaid goes and repeats this to Cuchulain.
&quot;O master Lugaid,&quot; quoth Cuchulain, &quot;it is a
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_140" name="Page_140" title="140">140</a>
snare!&quot; &quot;It is the word of a king; he hath said it,&quot;
Lugaid answered; &quot;there can be no snare in it.&quot; &quot;So
be it,&quot; said Cuchulain. Forthwith Lugaid leaves him and
takes that answer to Ailill and Medb. &quot;Let the fool go
forth in my form,&quot; said Ailill, &quot;and the king's crown on his
head, and let him stand some way off from Cuchulain lest
he know him; and let the girl go with him and let the
fool promise her to him, and let them depart quickly in this
wise. And methinks ye will play a trick on him thus, so
that he will not stop you any further till he comes with the
Ulstermen to the battle.&quot;</p>

<p>Then the fool goes to him and the girl along with him,
and from afar he addresses Cuchulain. The Hound comes to
meet him. It happened he knew by the man's speech that he
was a fool. A slingstone that was in his hand he threw at
him so that it entered his head and bore out his brains.
He comes up to the maiden, cuts off her two tresses and
thrusts a stone through her cloak and her tunic, and plants
a standing-stone through the middle of the fool. Their
two pillar-stones are there, even the pillar-stone of Finnabair
and the pillar-stone of the fool.</p>

<p>Cuchulain left them in this plight. A party was sent
out from Ailill and Medb to search for their people, for it
was long they thought they were gone, when they saw them
in this wise. This thing was noised abroad by all the host
in the camp. Thereafter there was no truce for them with
Cuchulain.<a name="footnotetag2_140" id="footnotetag2_140" href="#footnote2_140"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag2_141" id="footnotetag2_141" href="#footnote2_141"><sup>2</sup></a>While the hosts were there in the evening they perceived
that one stone fell on them coming from the east and another
from the west to meet it. The stones met one another
in the air and kept falling between Fergus' camp, the camp
of Ailill and the camp of Nera. This sport and play continued
from that hour till the same hour on the next day,
and the hosts spent the time sitting down, with their shields
over their heads to protect them from the blocks of stones,
till the plain was full of the boulders, whence cometh Mag
Clochair ('the Stony Plain'). Now it happened it was Curoi
macDar&egrave; did this. He had come to bring help to his
people and had taken his stand in Cotal to fight against
Munremar son of Gerrcend.<a name="footnotetaga_141" id="footnotetaga_141" href="#footnotea_141"><sup>a</sup></a> The latter had come from
Emain Macha to succour Cuchulain and had taken his
stand on Ard ('the Height') of Roch. Curoi knew there
was not in the host a man to compete with Munremar.
These then it was who carried on this sport between them.
The army prayed them to cease. Whereupon Munremar
and Curoi made peace, and Curoi withdrew to his house
and Munremar to Emain Macha and Munremar came not
again till the day of the battle. As for Curoi, he came
not till the combat of Ferdiad.</p>

<p>&quot;Pray Cuchulain,&quot; said Medb and Ailill, &quot;that he suffer
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_142" name="Page_142" title="142">142</a>
us to change our place.&quot; This then was granted to them
and the change was made.</p>

<p>The 'Pains' of the Ulstermen left them then. When
now they awoke from their 'Pains,' bands of them came
continually upon the host to restrain it again.</p>

<p>Now the youths of Ulster discussed the matter among
themselves in Emain Macha. &quot;Alas for us,&quot; said they,
&quot;that our friend Cuchulain has no one to succour him!&quot;
&quot;I would ask then,&quot; spake Fiachu Fulech ('the Bloody')
son of Ferfeb&egrave; and own brother to Fiachu<a name="footnotetagb_143" id="footnotetagb_143" href="#footnoteb_143"><sup>b</sup></a> Fialdana
('the Generous-daring') son of Ferfeb&egrave;, &quot;shall I have a
company from you to go to him with help?&quot;</p>

<p>Thrice fifty youths accompany him with their play-clubs,
and that was a third of the boy-troop of Ulster. The
army saw them drawing near them over the plain. &quot;A
great army approaches us over the plain,&quot; spake Ailill
Fergus goes to espy them. &quot;Some of the youths of Ulster
are they,&quot; said he, &quot;and it is to succour Cuchulain they
come.&quot; &quot;Let a troop go to meet them,&quot; said Ailill, &quot;unknown
to Cuchulain; for if they unite with him ye will
never overcome them.&quot; Thrice fifty warriors went out
to meet them. They fell at one another's hands, so that
not one of them got off alive of the number of the youths of
Lia Toll. Hence is Lia ('the Stone') of Fiachu son of
Ferfeb&egrave;, for it is there that he fell.</p>

<p>&quot;Take counsel,&quot; quoth Ailill; &quot;inquire of Cuchulain
about letting you go from hence, for ye will not go past
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_144" name="Page_144" title="144">144</a>
him by force, now that his flame of valour has risen.&quot; For
it was usual with him, when his hero's flame arose in him,
that his feet would turn back on him and his buttocks,
before him, and the knobs of his calves would come on his
shins, and one eye would be in his head and the other one
out of his head. A man's head would have gone into his
mouth. There was not a hair on him that was not as sharp
as the thorn of the haw, and a drop of blood was on each
single hair. He would recognize neither comrades nor
friends. Alike he would strike them before and behind.
Therefrom it was that the men of Connacht gave Cuchulain
the name Riastartha ('the Contorted One').</p>

son of Conchobar. &quot;It would be well worth while for
thyself if by thee fell Cuchulain.&quot; <a name="footnotetag1_147" id="footnotetag1_147" href="#footnote1_147"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;Howbeit,&quot; said C&ucirc;r,
&quot;since on myself it falls,<a href="#footnote1_147"><sup>1</sup></a> make ye ready a journey <a name="footnotetag2_147" id="footnotetag2_147" href="#footnote2_147"><sup>2</sup></a>for
me<a href="#footnote2_147"><sup>2</sup></a> at morn's early hour on the morrow, for a pleasure
I will make of the way <a name="footnotetag3_147" id="footnotetag3_147" href="#footnote3_147"><sup>3</sup></a>to this fight,<a href="#footnote3_147"><sup>3</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_147" id="footnotetag4_147" href="#footnote4_147"><sup>4</sup></a>a-going to meet
Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote4_147"><sup>4</sup></a> It is not this will detain you, namely the
killing of yonder wildling, Cuchulain!&quot;</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag5_147" id="footnotetag5_147" href="#footnote5_147"><sup>5</sup></a>There they passed the night.<a href="#footnote5_147"><sup>5</sup></a> Then early on the
morrow morn arose C&ucirc;r macDa Loth <a name="footnotetag6_147" id="footnotetag6_147" href="#footnote6_147"><sup>6</sup></a>and he came to the
ford of battle and combat; and however early he arose,
earlier still Cuchulain arose.<a href="#footnote6_147"><sup>6</sup></a> A cart-load of arms was
taken along with him wherewith to engage with Cuchulain,
and he began to ply his weapons, seeking to kill Cuchulain.</p>

<p>Now Cuchulain had gone early that day <a name="footnotetag7_147" id="footnotetag7_147" href="#footnote7_147"><sup>7</sup></a>to practise<a href="#footnote7_147"><sup>7</sup></a>
his feats <a name="footnotetag8_147" id="footnotetag8_147" href="#footnote8_147"><sup>8</sup></a>of valour and prowess.<a href="#footnote8_147"><sup>8</sup></a> These are the names of
them all: the Apple-feat, and the Edge-feat, and the Level
Shield-feat, and the Little Dart-feat, and the Rope-feat,
and the Body-feat, and the Feat of Catt, and the Hero's
Salmon-leap,<a name="footnotetaga_147" id="footnotetaga_147" href="#footnotea_147"><sup>a</sup></a> and the Pole-cast, and the Leap over a
Blow (?), and the Folding of a noble Chariot-fighter, and
the Gae Bulga ('the Barbed Spear') and the Vantage (?) of
Swiftness, and the Wheel-feat, <a name="footnotetag9_147" id="footnotetag9_147" href="#footnote9_147"><sup>9</sup></a>and the Rim-feat,<a href="#footnote9_147"><sup>9</sup></a> and
the Over-Breath-feat, and the Breaking of a Sword, and
the Champion's Cry, and the Measured Stroke, and the Side
Stroke, and the Running up a Lance and standing erect
on its Point, and the Binding of the <a name="footnotetag10_147" id="footnotetag10_147" href="#footnote10_147"><sup>10</sup></a>noble<a href="#footnote10_147"><sup>10</sup></a> Hero

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_148" name="Page_148" title="148">148</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 2121.</span>
Now this is the reason Cuchulain was wont to practise
early every morning each of those feats <a name="footnotetag1_148" id="footnotetag1_148" href="#footnote1_148"><sup>1</sup></a>with the agility
of a single hand, as best a wild-cat may,<a href="#footnote1_148"><sup>1</sup></a> in order that they
might not depart from him through forgetfulness or lack
of remembrance.</p>

<p>And macDa Loth waited beside his shield until the third
part of the day, <a name="footnotetag2_148" id="footnotetag2_148" href="#footnote2_148"><sup>2</sup></a>plying his weapons,<a href="#footnote2_148"><sup>2</sup></a> seeking the chance
to kill Cuchulain; <a name="footnotetag3_148" id="footnotetag3_148" href="#footnote3_148"><sup>3</sup></a>and not the stroke of a blow reached
Cuchulain, because of the intensity of his feats, nor was he
aware that a warrior was thrusting at him.<a href="#footnote3_148"><sup>3</sup></a> It was then
Laeg<a name="footnotetaga_148" id="footnotetaga_148" href="#footnotea_148"><sup>a</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_148" id="footnotetag4_148" href="#footnote4_148"><sup>4</sup></a>looked at him<a href="#footnote4_148"><sup>4</sup></a> and spake to Cuchulain, &quot;Hark!
Cucuc. Attend to the warrior that seeks to kill thee.&quot;
Then it was that Cuchulain glanced at him and then it was
that he raised and threw the eight apples on high <a name="footnotetag5_148" id="footnotetag5_148" href="#footnote5_148"><sup>5</sup></a>and
cast the ninth apple<a href="#footnote5_148"><sup>5</sup></a> a throw's length from him at C&ucirc;r
macDa Loth, so that it struck on the disk of his shield
<a name="footnotetag6_148" id="footnotetag6_148" href="#footnote6_148"><sup>6</sup></a>between the edge and the body of the shield<a href="#footnote6_148"><sup>6</sup></a> and on the
forehead <a name="footnotetag7_148" id="footnotetag7_148" href="#footnote7_148"><sup>7</sup></a>of the churl,<a href="#footnote7_148"><sup>7</sup></a> so that it carried the size of an apple
of his brains out through the back of his head. Thus fell
C&ucirc;r macDa Loth also at the hand of Cuchulain. <a name="footnotetag8_148" id="footnotetag8_148" href="#footnote8_148"><sup>8</sup></a>According
to another version<a href="#footnote8_148"><sup>8</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag9_148" id="footnotetag9_148" href="#footnote9_148"><sup>9</sup></a>it was in Imslige Glendamnach
that C&ucirc;r fell.<a href="#footnote9_148"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag10_148" id="footnotetag10_148" href="#footnote10_148"><sup>10</sup></a>Fergus greeted each one there and this is what he
said:<a href="#footnote10_148"><sup>10</sup></a> &quot;If your engagements and pledges bind you now,&quot;
said Fergus, &quot;another warrior ye must send to him yonder
on the ford; else, do ye keep to your camp and your quarters
here till the bright hour of sunrise on the morrow, for C&ucirc;r
son of Da Loth is fallen.&quot; <a name="footnotetag11_148" id="footnotetag11_148" href="#footnote11_148"><sup>11</sup></a>&quot;We will grant that,&quot; said
Medb, &quot;and we will not pitch tents nor take quarters here
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_149" name="Page_149" title="149">149</a>
now, but we will remain where we were last night in camp.<a name="footnotetag11_149" id="footnotetag11_149" href="#footnote11_148"><sup>11</sup></a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2136.</span>
Considering why we have come, it is the same to us
even though we remain in those same tents.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag1_149" id="footnotetag1_149" href="#footnote1_149"><sup>1</sup></a>The four great provinces of Erin<a href="#footnote1_149"><sup>1</sup></a> remained in that

of Tri Aigneach. These then fell in single combat with
Cuchulain. But it is tedious to recount one by one the
cunning and valour of each man of them.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag2_150" id="footnotetag2_150" href="#footnote2_150"><sup>2</sup></a>Then again the men of Erin took counsel who would be fit
to fight and do combat with Cuchulain and to ward him
off from them on the ford at the morning-hour early on the
morrow. What they each and all said was, that it would
be his own friend and companion and the man who was his
equal in arms and feats, even Ferbaeth son of Ferbend.</p>

<p>Then was Ferbaeth son of Ferbend summoned to them,
to the tent of Ailill and Medb. &quot;Wherefore do ye call me
to you?&quot; Ferbaeth asked. &quot;In sooth, it would please
us,&quot; Medb answered, &quot;for thee to do battle and contend
with Cuchulain, and to ward him off from us on the ford
at the morning hour early on the morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>Great rewards they promised to him for making the
battle and combat.<a href="#footnote2_150"><sup>2</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_150" id="footnotetag3_150" href="#footnote3_150"><sup>3</sup></a>Finnabair is given to him for this
and the kingdom of his race, for he was their choice to
combat Cuchulain. He was the man they thought worthy
of him, for they both had learned the same service in arms
with Scathach.<a href="#footnote3_150"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag4_150" id="footnotetag4_150" href="#footnote4_150"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;I have no desire to act thus,&quot; Ferbaeth protested.
&quot;Cuchulain is my foster-brother and of everlasting covenant
with me. Yet will I go meet him to-morrow, so
shall I strike off his head!&quot; &quot;It will be thou that canst
do it,&quot; Medb made answer.<a href="#footnote4_150"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_151" name="Page_151" title="151">151</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 2143.</span>
Then it was that Cuchulain said to his charioteer, namely
to Laeg: &quot;Betake thee thither, O master Laeg,&quot; said
Cuchulain, &quot;to the camp of the men of Erin, and bear a
greeting <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 74b.</span> from me to my comrades and foster-brothers
and age-mates. Bear a greeting to Ferdiad son of Daman,
and to Ferdet son of Daman, and to Brass son of Ferb,
and to Lugaid son of Nos, and to Lugaid son of Solamach,
to Ferbaeth son of Baetan, and to Ferbaeth son of Ferbend,
and a particular greeting withal to mine own foster-brother,
to Lugaid son of Nos, for that he is the one man
that still has friendliness and friendship with me now on
the hosting. And bear him a blessing. <a name="footnotetag1_151" id="footnotetag1_151" href="#footnote1_151"><sup>1</sup></a>Let it be asked
diligently of him<a href="#footnote1_151"><sup>1</sup></a> that he may tell thee who <a name="footnotetag2_151" id="footnotetag2_151" href="#footnote2_151"><sup>2</sup></a>of the men
of Erin<a href="#footnote2_151"><sup>2</sup></a> will come to attack me on the morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Laeg went his way to the camp of the men of Erin
and brought the aforementioned greetings to the comrades
and foster-brothers of Cuchulain. And he also went
into the tent of Lugaid son of Nos. Lugaid bade him
welcome. &quot;I take <a name="footnotetag3_151" id="footnotetag3_151" href="#footnote3_151"><sup>3</sup></a>that welcome<a href="#footnote3_151"><sup>3</sup></a> to be truly meant,&quot;
said Laeg. &quot;'Tis truly meant for thee,&quot; replied Lugaid.
&quot;To converse with thee am I come from Cuchulain,&quot; said
Laeg, &quot;and I bring these greetings truly and earnestly from
him to the end that thou tell me who comes to fight with
Cuchulain to-day.&quot; <a name="footnotetag4_151" id="footnotetag4_151" href="#footnote4_151"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;Truly not lucky is it for Cuchulain,&quot;
said Lugaid, &quot;the strait wherein he is alone against
the men of Erin.<a href="#footnote4_151"><sup>4</sup></a> The curse of his fellowship and brotherhood
and of his friendship and affection <a name="footnotetag5_151" id="footnotetag5_151" href="#footnote5_151"><sup>5</sup></a>and of his arms<a href="#footnote5_151"><sup>5</sup></a>
be upon that man; even his own real foster-brother himself,
<a name="footnotetag6_151" id="footnotetag6_151" href="#footnote6_151"><sup>6</sup></a>even the companion of us both,<a href="#footnote6_151"><sup>6</sup></a> Ferbaeth son of
Ferbend. <a name="footnotetag7_151" id="footnotetag7_151" href="#footnote7_151"><sup>7</sup></a>He it is that comes to meet him to-morrow.<a href="#footnote7_151"><sup>7</sup></a>
He was invited into the tent of <a name="footnotetag8_151" id="footnotetag8_151" href="#footnote8_151"><sup>8</sup></a>Ailill and<a href="#footnote8_151"><sup>8</sup></a> Medb a while
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_152" name="Page_152" title="152">152</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2165.</span>
since. The daughter Finnabair was set by his side. It is
she who fills up the drinking-horns for him; it is she who
gives him a kiss with every drink that he takes; it is she
who serveth the food <a name="footnotetag1_152" id="footnotetag1_152" href="#footnote1_152"><sup>1</sup></a>to him.<a href="#footnote1_152"><sup>1</sup></a> Not for every one with

is drunk.<a href="#footnote2_152"><sup>2</sup></a> Only fifty wagon-loads of it have been brought
to the camp.&quot;</p>

<p>Then with heavy head, sorrowful, downcast, heaving
sighs, Laeg retraced his steps to Cuchulain. &quot;With heavy
head, sorrowful, downcast and sighing, my master Laeg
comes to meet me,&quot; said Cuchulain. &quot;It must be that
one of my brothers-in-arms comes to attack me.&quot; For he
regarded as worse a man of the same training in arms
as himself than aught other warrior. &quot;Hail now, O
Laeg my friend,&quot; cried Cuchulain; &quot;who comes to
attack me to-day?&quot; &quot;The curse of his fellowship and
brotherhood, of his friendship and affection be upon him;
even thine own real foster-brother himself, namely Ferbaeth
son of Ferbend. A while ago he was summoned
into the tent of Medb. The maiden was set by his side;
It is she who fills up the drinking-horns for him; it is
she who gives him a kiss with every drink; it is she
who serveth his food. Not for every one with Medb is the
ale that is poured out for Ferbaeth. Only fifty wagon-loads
of it have been brought to the camp.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag3_152" id="footnotetag3_152" href="#footnote3_152"><sup>3</sup></a>Cuchulain bade Laeg go to Lugaid, that he come to
talk with him. Lugaid came to Cuchulain. &quot;So Ferbaeth
comes to oppose me to-morrow,&quot; said Cuchulain. &quot;Aye,
then,&quot; answered Lugaid.<a href="#footnote3_152"><sup>3</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_152" id="footnotetag4_152" href="#footnote4_152"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;Evil is this day,&quot; cried
Cuchulain. &quot;I shall not be alive thereafter. Two of the
same age are we, two of equal deftness, two of equal

weight, when we come together. O Lugaid, greet him for
me. Tell him, also, it is not the part of true valour to
come to oppose me. Tell him to come meet me to-night
to speak with me.&quot;</p>

<p>Lugaid brought back this word to Ferbaeth. Now
inasmuch as Ferbaeth shunned not the parley,<a name="footnotetag4_153" id="footnotetag4_153" href="#footnote4_153"><sup>4</sup></a> <span class="sidenoteL">W. 2183.</span> he by no

thee then is at an end,&quot;<a href="#footnote9_153"><sup>9</sup></a> cried Cuchulain,<a href="#footnote7_153"><sup>7</sup></a> and in anger he
left him and drove the sole of his foot against a holly-spit
<a name="footnotetag10_153" id="footnotetag10_153" href="#footnote10_153"><sup>10</sup></a>in the glen,<a href="#footnote10_153"><sup>10</sup></a> so that it pierced through flesh and bone and
skin <a name="footnotetag11_153" id="footnotetag11_153" href="#footnote11_153"><sup>11</sup></a>and came out by his knee.<a href="#footnote11_153"><sup>11</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag12_153" id="footnotetag12_153" href="#footnote12_153"><sup>12</sup></a>Thereat Cuchulain
became frantic, and he gave a strong tug and<a href="#footnote12_153"><sup>12</sup></a> drew the
spit out from its roots, <a name="footnotetag13_153" id="footnotetag13_153" href="#footnote13_153"><sup>13</sup></a>from sinew and bone, from flesh
and from skin.<a href="#footnote13_153"><sup>13</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag14_153" id="footnotetag14_153" href="#footnote14_153"><sup>14</sup></a>&quot;Go not, Ferbaeth, till thou seest
the find I have made.&quot; &quot;Throw it then,&quot; cried Ferbaeth.<a href="#footnote14_153"><sup>14</sup></a>
And Cuchulain threw the holly-spit over his
shoulder after Ferbaeth, and he would as lief that it reached
him or that it reached him not. The spit struck Ferbaeth
in the nape of the neck,<a name="footnotetagb_153" id="footnotetagb_153" href="#footnoteb_153"><sup>b</sup></a> so that it passed out through his

mouth <a name="footnotetag1_154" id="footnotetag1_154" href="#footnote1_154"><sup>1</sup></a>in front<a href="#footnote1_154"><sup>1</sup></a> and fell to the ground, and thus Ferbaeth
fell <a name="footnotetag2_154" id="footnotetag2_154" href="#footnote2_154"><sup>2</sup></a>backward into the glen.<a href="#footnote2_154"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Now that was a good throw, Cucuc!&quot; cried <a name="footnotetag3_154" id="footnotetag3_154" href="#footnote3_154"><sup>3</sup></a>Fiachu
son of Ferfeb&egrave;,<a href="#footnote3_154"><sup>3</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_154" id="footnotetag4_154" href="#footnote4_154"><sup>4</sup></a>who was on the mound between the two

warrior with a spit of holly. Hence it is that Focherd

of the place where they were.</p>

Lugaid.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag3_157" id="footnotetag3_157" href="#footnote3_157"><sup>3</sup></a>Laeg betook him to where Cuchulain was.<a href="#footnote3_157"><sup>3</sup></a> Lugaid's
two horses were taken and his chariot was yoked to them
<a name="footnotetag4_157" id="footnotetag4_157" href="#footnote4_157"><sup>4</sup></a>and<a href="#footnote4_157"><sup>4</sup></a> he came <a name="footnotetag5_157" id="footnotetag5_157" href="#footnote5_157"><sup>5</sup></a>to Glen Ferbaeth<a href="#footnote5_157"><sup>5</sup></a> to his tryst with

two champions and battle-warriors gave each other welcome.<a href="#footnote6_157"><sup>6</sup></a>
Then it was that Lugaid spake: <a name="footnotetag7_157" id="footnotetag7_157" href="#footnote7_157"><sup>7</sup></a>&quot;There is no
condition that could be promised to me for fighting and
combating with thee,&quot; said Lugaid, &quot;and there is no condition
on which I would undertake it, but<a href="#footnote7_157"><sup>7</sup></a> they are persuading
a brother of mine to come fight thee <a name="footnotetag8_157" id="footnotetag8_157" href="#footnote8_157"><sup>8</sup></a>on the

stout blows. <a name="footnotetag9_157" id="footnotetag9_157" href="#footnote9_157"><sup>9</sup></a>They brought him into the tent of Ailill

and to see if I myself will come to avenge him upon thee.
But I will not, till the very day of doom. And by the
fellowship that is between us, <a name="footnotetag12_157" id="footnotetag12_157" href="#footnote12_157"><sup>12</sup></a>and by the rearing and
nurture I bestowed on thee and thou didst bestow on me,
bear me no grudge because of Larin&egrave;.<a href="#footnote12_157"><sup>12</sup></a> Slay not my brother
<a name="footnotetag13_157" id="footnotetag13_157" href="#footnote13_157"><sup>13</sup></a>lest thou shouldst leave me brotherless.&quot;<a href="#footnote13_157"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;By my conscience, truly,&quot; cried Cuchulain, <a name="footnotetag14_157" id="footnotetag14_157" href="#footnote14_157"><sup>14</sup></a>kill him
I will not, but<a href="#footnote14_157"><sup>14</sup></a> the next thing to death will I inflict on
him. <a name="footnotetag15_157" id="footnotetag15_157" href="#footnote15_157"><sup>15</sup></a>No worse would it be for him to die than what I
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_158" name="Page_158" title="158">158</a>

will give him.&quot;<a name="footnotetag15_158" id="footnotetag15_158" href="#footnote15_157"><sup>15</sup></a> &quot;I give thee leave. <a name="footnotetag1_158" id="footnotetag1_158" href="#footnote1_158"><sup>1</sup></a>It would please
me well shouldst thou beat him sorely,<a href="#footnote1_158"><sup>1</sup></a> for to my dishonour
he comes to attack thee.&quot;</p>

<p>Thereupon Cuchulain went back and Lugaid returned
to the camp <a name="footnotetag2_158" id="footnotetag2_158" href="#footnote2_158"><sup>2</sup></a>lest the men of Erin should say it was betraying
them or forsaking them he was if he remained longer
parleying with Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote2_158"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Then <a name="footnotetag3_158" id="footnotetag3_158" href="#footnote3_158"><sup>3</sup></a>on the next day<a href="#footnote3_158"><sup>3</sup></a> it was that Larin&egrave; son of

to the tent of Ailill and Medb, and Finnabair was
placed by his side. It was she that filled up the drinking-horns
for him and gave him a kiss with each draught that
he took and served him his food. &quot;Not to every one
with Medb is given the drink that is poured out for
Ferbaeth or for Larin&egrave;,&quot; quoth Finnabair; &quot;only the
load of fifty wagons of it was brought to the camp.&quot;<a name="footnotetaga_158" id="footnotetaga_158" href="#footnotea_158"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag5_158" id="footnotetag5_158" href="#footnote5_158"><sup>5</sup></a>Medb looked at the pair. &quot;Yonder pair rejoiceth
my heart,&quot; said she.<a href="#footnote5_158"><sup>5</sup></a> &quot;Whom wouldst thou say?&quot;
asked <a name="footnotetag6_158" id="footnotetag6_158" href="#footnote6_158"><sup>6</sup></a>Ailill.<a href="#footnote6_158"><sup>6</sup></a> &quot;The man yonder, <a name="footnotetag7_158" id="footnotetag7_158" href="#footnote7_158"><sup>7</sup></a>in truth,&quot;<a href="#footnote7_158"><sup>7</sup></a> said
she. &quot;What of him?&quot; asked Ailill. &quot;It is thy wont to
set the mind on that which is far from the purpose (Medb
answered). It were more becoming for thee to bestow
thy thought on the couple in whom are united the greatest
distinction and beauty to be found on any road in Erin,
namely Finnabair, <a name="footnotetag8_158" id="footnotetag8_158" href="#footnote8_158"><sup>8</sup></a>my daughter,<a href="#footnote8_158"><sup>8</sup></a> and Larin&egrave; macNois.
<a name="footnotetag9_158" id="footnotetag9_158" href="#footnote9_158"><sup>9</sup></a>'Twould be fitting to bring them together.&quot;<a href="#footnote9_158"><sup>9</sup></a> &quot;I regard

thee herein. He shall have her if only he brings me the

<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2235.</span> It was then that Larin&egrave; shook and tossed himself with joy,
so that the sewings of the flock bed burst under him and
the mead of the camp was speckled with its feathers.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag1_159" id="footnotetag1_159" href="#footnote1_159"><sup>1</sup></a>They passed the night there.<a href="#footnote1_159"><sup>1</sup></a> Larin&egrave; longed for
day with its full light <a name="footnotetag2_159" id="footnotetag2_159" href="#footnote2_159"><sup>2</sup></a>to go<a href="#footnote2_159"><sup>2</sup></a> to attack Cuchulain.
At the early day-dawn on the morrow he came, <a name="footnotetag3_159" id="footnotetag3_159" href="#footnote3_159"><sup>3</sup></a>and the
maiden came too to embolden him,<a href="#footnote3_159"><sup>3</sup></a> and he brought a
wagon-load of arms with him, and he came on to the ford
to encounter Cuchulain. The mighty warriors of the camp
and station considered it not a goodly enough sight to view
the combat of Larin&egrave;; only the women and boys and girls,
<a name="footnotetag4_159" id="footnotetag4_159" href="#footnote4_159"><sup>4</sup></a>thrice fifty of them,<a href="#footnote4_159"><sup>4</sup></a> went to scoff and to jeer at his
battle.</p>

<p>Cuchulain went to meet him at the ford and he deemed
it unbecoming to bring along arms <a name="footnotetag5_159" id="footnotetag5_159" href="#footnote5_159"><sup>5</sup></a>or to ply weapons
upon him,<a href="#footnote5_159"><sup>5</sup></a> so Cuchulain came to the encounter unarmed
<a name="footnotetag6_159" id="footnotetag6_159" href="#footnote6_159"><sup>6</sup></a>except for the weapons he wrested from his opponent.<a href="#footnote6_159"><sup>6</sup></a>
<a name="footnotetag7_159" id="footnotetag7_159" href="#footnote7_159"><sup>7</sup></a>And when Larin&egrave; reached the ford, Cuchulain saw him
and made a rush at him.<a href="#footnote7_159"><sup>7</sup></a> Cuchulain knocked all of
Larin&egrave;'s weapons out of his hand as one might knock toys
out of the hand of an infant. Cuchulain ground and bruised
him between his arms, he lashed him and clasped him,
he squeezed him and shook him, so that he spilled all the
dirt out of him, <a name="footnotetag8_159" id="footnotetag8_159" href="#footnote8_159"><sup>8</sup></a>so that the ford was defiled with his dung<a href="#footnote8_159"><sup>8</sup></a>
<a name="footnotetag9_159" id="footnotetag9_159" href="#footnote9_159"><sup>9</sup></a>and the air was fouled with his dust<a href="#footnote9_159"><sup>9</sup></a> and an <a href="#footnote10_159"><sup>10</sup></a>unclean,
filthy<a href="#footnote10_159"><sup>10</sup></a> wrack of cloud arose in the four airts wherein he was.
Then from the middle of the ford Cuchulain hurled Larin&egrave;
far from him across through the camp <a name="footnotetag11_159" id="footnotetag11_159" href="#footnote11_159"><sup>11</sup></a>till he fell into
Lugaid's two hands<a href="#footnote11_159"><sup>11</sup></a> at the door of the tent of his brother.

free from weakness of the loins and oppression of the chest

him to go out. Still he is the only man that made escape,
<a name="footnotetag7_160" id="footnotetag7_160" href="#footnote7_160"><sup>7</sup></a>yea though a bad escape,<a href="#footnote7_160"><sup>7</sup></a> after combat with Cuchulain
on the Cualnge Cattle-raid. Nevertheless that maiming
took effect upon him, so that it afterwards brought him
his death. Such then is the Combat of Larin&egrave; on the T&aacute;in

that, methinks, than daughter of a king! I will seize thee,&quot;

and thou shalt remain in such sorry plight till there come
my sentence of blessing on thee.&quot; &quot;In the shape of a grey
she-wolf will I drive the cattle on to the ford against thee.&quot;

thee on the waters and fords and pools and thou wilt not

Loch Mor ('the Great') son of Mofemis, the royal champion

<a name="footnotetag1_164" id="footnotetag1_164" href="#footnote1_164"><sup>1</sup></a>Thereupon<a href="#footnote1_164"><sup>1</sup></a> Long was summoned to the tent of Ailill

Loch <a name="footnotetag4_164" id="footnotetag4_164" href="#footnote4_164"><sup>4</sup></a>came forth and raised up his loud, quick voice
and<a href="#footnote4_164"><sup>4</sup></a> cried, had he known it was a bearded man that slew

west, that ye may cross, and let the law of fair fight be
broken with Cuchulain.&quot; The seven Man&egrave; the warriors
went first, till they saw him to the west of the edge of the
ford. He wore his festive raiment on that day and the
women clambered on the men that they might behold
him. &quot;It grieves me,&quot; said Medb. &quot;I cannot see the boy
because of whom they go there.&quot; &quot;Thy mind would not
be the easier for that,&quot; quoth Lethrenn, Ailill's horseboy,
&quot;if thou shouldst see him.&quot; Cuchulain came to the ford
as he was. &quot;What man is that yonder, O Fergus?&quot; asked
Medb.<a name="footnotetagc_164" id="footnotetagc_164" href="#footnotec_164"><sup>c</sup></a> And Medb, too, climbed on the men to get a look

for two woman-bands,<a href="#footnote2_165"><sup>2</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_165" id="footnotetag3_165" href="#footnote3_165"><sup>3</sup></a>fifty or twice fifty<a href="#footnote3_165"><sup>3</sup></a> of her
women, to go speak with Cuchulain and to charge him to
put a false beard on. The woman-troop went their way to
Cuchulain and told him to put a false beard on <a name="footnotetag4_165" id="footnotetag4_165" href="#footnote4_165"><sup>4</sup></a>if he
wished to engage in battle or combat with goodly warriors
or with goodly youths of the men of Erin;<a href="#footnote4_165"><sup>4</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag5_165" id="footnotetag5_165" href="#footnote5_165"><sup>5</sup></a>that sport
was made of him in the camp for that he had no beard,
and that no good warrior would go meet him but only madmen.
It were easier to make a false beard:<a href="#footnote5_165"><sup>5</sup></a> &quot;For no brave
warrior in the camp thinks it seemly to come fight with
thee, and thou beardless,&quot; <a name="footnotetag6_165" id="footnotetag6_165" href="#footnote6_165"><sup>6</sup></a>said they.<a href="#footnote6_165"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="#footnote7_165"><sup>7</sup></a>&quot;If that
please me,&quot; said Cuchulain, &quot;then I shall do it.&quot;<a href="#footnote7_165"><sup>7</sup></a> Thereupon
Cuchulain <a name="footnotetag8_165" id="footnotetag8_165" href="#footnote8_165"><sup>8</sup></a>took a handful of grass and speaking a
spell over it he<a href="#footnote8_165"><sup>8</sup></a> bedaubed himself a beard <a name="footnotetag9_165" id="footnotetag9_165" href="#footnote9_165"><sup>9</sup></a>in order to
obtain combat with a man, namely with Loch.<a href="#footnote9_165"><sup>9</sup></a> And he
came onto the knoll overlooking the men of Erin and
made that beard manifest to them all, <a name="footnotetag10_165" id="footnotetag10_165" href="#footnote10_165"><sup>10</sup></a>so that every one
thought it was a real beard he had.<a href="#footnote10_165"><sup>10</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag11_165" id="footnotetag11_165" href="#footnote11_165"><sup>11</sup></a>&quot;'Tis true,&quot; spake
the women,<a name="footnotetaga_165" id="footnotetaga_165" href="#footnotea_165"><sup>a</sup></a> &quot;Cuchulain has a beard. It is fitting for a
warrior to fight with him.&quot; They said that to urge on
Loch.<a href="#footnote11_165"><sup>11</sup></a> Loch son of Mofemis saw it, and what he said
was, &quot;Why, that is a beard on Cuchulain!&quot; &quot;It is what
I perceive,&quot; Medb answered. Medb promised the same
great terms to Loch to put a check to Cuchulain. <a name="footnotetag12_165" id="footnotetag12_165" href="#footnote12_165"><sup>12</sup></a>&quot;I
will not undertake the fight till the end of seven days from
this day,&quot; exclaimed Loch. &quot;Not fitting is it for us to
leave that man unattacked for all that time,&quot; Medb answered.
&quot;Let us put a warrior every night to spy upon him
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_166" name="Page_166" title="166">166</a>
if, peradventure, we might get a chance at him.&quot; This
then they did. A warrior went every night to spy upon
him and he slew them all. These are the names of the
men who fell there: the seven Conall, the seven Oengus, the
seven Uargus, the seven Celtri, the eight Fiach, the ten Ailill,
the ten Delbrath, the ten Tasach. These are the deeds of
that week on Ath Grenca.</p>

<p>Medb sought counsel, what was best to be done with
Cuchulain, for she was sore grieved at all of her host that
had been slain by him. This is the counsel she took: To
despatch keen, high-spirited men at one time to attack
him when he would come to an appointment she would
make to speak with him. For she had a tryst the next
day with Cuchulain, to conclude the pretence of a truce
with him in order to get a chance at him. She sent forth
messengers to seek him to advise him to come to her, and
thus it was that he should come, unarmed, for she herself
would not come but with her women attendants to converse
with him.</p>

<p>The runner, namely Traigtren ('Strongfoot') <a name="footnotetag1_166" id="footnotetag1_166" href="#footnote1_166"><sup>1</sup></a>son of
Traiglethan ('Broadfoot')<a href="#footnote1_166"><sup>1</sup></a> went to the place where Cuchulain
was and gave him Medb's message. Cuchulain promised
that he would do her will. &quot;How liketh it thee to meet
Medb to-morrow, O Cuchulain?&quot; asked Laeg. &quot;Even
as Medb desires it,&quot; answered Cuchulain. &quot;Great are
Medb's deeds,&quot; said the charioteer; &quot;I fear a hand behind
the back with her.&quot; &quot;How is it to be done <a name="footnotetag2_166" id="footnotetag2_166" href="#footnote2_166"><sup>2</sup></a>by us<a href="#footnote2_166"><sup>2</sup></a> then?&quot;
asked he. &quot;Thy sword at thy waist,&quot; the charioteer
answered, &quot;that thou be not taken off thy guard. For a
warrior is not entitled to his honour-price if he be taken
without arms, and it is the coward's law that falls to him
in this manner.&quot; &quot;Let it be so, then,&quot; said Cuchulain.</p>

<p>Now it was on Ard ('the Height') of Aignech which is
called Fochard to-day that the meeting took place. Then
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_167" name="Page_167" title="167">167</a>
fared Medb to the tryst and she stationed fourteen men
of those that were bravest of her bodyguard in ambush
against him. These were they: the two Glassin&egrave;, the two
sons of Buccridi, the two Ardan, the two sons of Licc&egrave;, the
two Glasogma, the two sons of Crund, Drucht and Delt and
Dathen, Tea and Tascur and Tualang, Taur and Gles&egrave;.</p>

<p>Then Cuchulain comes to meet her. The men rise against
him. Fourteen spears are hurled at him at the same time.
The Hound defends himself, so that neither his skin nor
protection (?) is touched and he turns in upon them and
kills them, the fourteen men. Hence these are the 'Fourteen
men of Fochard.' And they are also the 'Men of
Cronech,' for it is in Cronech at Fochard they were slain.
And it is of this Cuchulain spake:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div>&quot;Good my skill<a name="footnotetaga_167" id="footnotetaga_167" href="#footnotea_167"><sup>a</sup></a> in champion's deeds.</div>

<div>On the brilliant phantom host.</div>
<div>War with numerous bands I wage,</div>

<p>This is the reason why the name Focherd clung to that
place, to wit: <i>Fo</i> 'Good' and <i>Cerd</i> 'Art,' which signifieth
'Good the feat of arms' that happened to Cuchulain there.</p>

<p>Then came Cuchulain and he overtook <a name="footnotetag1_167" id="footnotetag1_167" href="#footnote1_167"><sup>1</sup></a>the hosts<a href="#footnote1_167"><sup>1</sup></a> pitching
camp, and there were slain the two Daigri, the two Anli
and the four Dungai of Imlech. And there Medb began to
urge on Loch: &quot;Great is the scorn that is made of thee,&quot;
said she, &quot;that the man that killed thy brother should be
destroying our host <a name="footnotetag2_167" id="footnotetag2_167" href="#footnote2_167"><sup>2</sup></a>here before thee<a href="#footnote2_167"><sup>2</sup></a> and thou not
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_168" name="Page_168" title="168">168</a>
attack him. For sure we are that such as he yonder, that
great and fierce madman, will not be able to withstand the
valour and rage of a warrior such as thou art. And, further,
from one and the same instructress the art was acquired by
you both.&quot;<a name="footnotetag12_168" id="footnotetag12_168" href="#footnote12_168"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 2283.</span>
&quot;I will go forth and attack him,&quot; cried Loch. Loch
went to attack Cuchulain, <a name="footnotetag1_168" id="footnotetag1_168" href="#footnote1_168"><sup>1</sup></a>to take vengeance on him for
his brother,<a href="#footnote1_168"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_168" id="footnotetag2_168" href="#footnote2_168"><sup>2</sup></a>for it was shown him that Cuchulain had
a beard;<a href="#footnote2_168"><sup>2</sup></a> so they met on the ford where Long had fallen.
&quot;Let us move to the upper ford,&quot; said Loch, &quot;for I will
not fight on this ford,&quot; since he held it defiled, <a name="footnotetag3_168" id="footnotetag3_168" href="#footnote3_168"><sup>3</sup></a>cursed and
unclean,<a href="#footnote3_168"><sup>3</sup></a> the ford whereon his brother had fallen. <a name="footnotetag4_168" id="footnotetag4_168" href="#footnote4_168"><sup>4</sup></a>Now
when Cuchulain came to look for the ford, the men drove
the cattle across.<a href="#footnote4_168"><sup>4</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag5_168" id="footnotetag5_168" href="#footnote5_168"><sup>5</sup></a>&quot;The cattle<a href="#footnote5_168"><sup>5</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag6_168" id="footnotetag6_168" href="#footnote6_168"><sup>6</sup></a>will be across thy

cometh Ath Tarteise ('the Ford over thy Water') and Tir
Mor Tarteise ('the Great Land over thy Water').<a href="#footnote8_168"><sup>8</sup></a> Thereafter
they fought on the upper ford <a name="footnotetag9_168" id="footnotetag9_168" href="#footnote9_168"><sup>9</sup></a>between Meth&egrave; and

space and time at their feats wounding and striking each
other.<a href="#footnote10_168"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Then it was that the Morrigan daughter of <a name="footnotetag11_168" id="footnotetag11_168" href="#footnote11_168"><sup>11</sup></a>Aed<a href="#footnote11_168"><sup>11</sup></a>
Ernmas came from the fairy dwellings to destroy Cuchulain.
For she had threatened on the Cattle-raid of Regomain <a name="footnotetaga_168" id="footnotetaga_168" href="#footnotea_168"><sup>a</sup></a>
that she would come to undo Cuchulain what time he would
be <a name="footnotetag13_168" id="footnotetag13_168" href="#footnote13_168"><sup>13</sup></a>in sore distress<a href="#footnote13_168"><sup>13</sup></a> when engaged in <a name="footnotetag14_168" id="footnotetag14_168" href="#footnote14_168"><sup>14</sup></a>battle and<a href="#footnote14_168"><sup>14</sup></a>
combat with a goodly warrior, <a name="footnotetag15_168" id="footnotetag15_168" href="#footnote15_168"><sup>15</sup></a>with Loch,<a href="#footnote15_168"><sup>15</sup></a> in the course
of the Cattle-spoil of Cualnge. Thither then the Morrigan
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_169" name="Page_169" title="169">169</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2293.</span>
came in the shape of a white, <a name="footnotetag1_169" id="footnotetag1_169" href="#footnote1_169"><sup>1</sup></a>hornless,<a href="#footnote1_169"><sup>1</sup></a> red-eared heifer,
with fifty heifers about her and a chain of silvered bronze
between each two of the heifers. <a name="footnotetag2_169" id="footnotetag2_169" href="#footnote2_169"><sup>2</sup></a>She bursts upon the
pools and fords at the head of the cattle. It was then that
Cuchulain said, &quot;I cannot see the fords for the waters.&quot;<a href="#footnote2_169"><sup>2</sup></a>
The women <a name="footnotetag3_169" id="footnotetag3_169" href="#footnote3_169"><sup>3</sup></a>came with their strange sorcery, and<a href="#footnote3_169"><sup>3</sup></a> constrained
Cuchulain by geasa and by inviolable bonds <a name="footnotetag4_169" id="footnotetag4_169" href="#footnote4_169"><sup>4</sup></a>to
check the heifer for them<a href="#footnote4_169"><sup>4</sup></a> lest she should escape from him
without harm. Cuchulain made an unerring cast <a name="footnotetag5_169" id="footnotetag5_169" href="#footnote5_169"><sup>5</sup></a>from his
sling-stick<a href="#footnote5_169"><sup>5</sup></a> at her, so that he shattered one of the Morrigan's
eyes.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag6_169" id="footnotetag6_169" href="#footnote6_169"><sup>6</sup></a>Now when the men met on the ford and began to fight
and to struggle, and when each of them was about to strike
the other,<a href="#footnote6_169"><sup>6</sup></a> the Morrigan came thither in the shape of a
slippery, black eel down the stream. Then she came on the
linn and she coiled <a name="footnotetag7_169" id="footnotetag7_169" href="#footnote7_169"><sup>7</sup></a>three folds<a href="#footnote7_169"><sup>7</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag8_169" id="footnotetag8_169" href="#footnote8_169"><sup>8</sup></a>and twists<a href="#footnote8_169"><sup>8</sup></a> around

<a name="footnotetag11_169" id="footnotetag11_169" href="#footnote11_169"><sup>11</sup></a>till he was lying on his back athwart the ford<a href="#footnote11_169"><sup>11</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag12_169" id="footnotetag12_169" href="#footnote12_169"><sup>12</sup></a>and his

<p>While Cuchulain was busied freeing himself <a name="footnotetag13_169" id="footnotetag13_169" href="#footnote13_169"><sup>13</sup></a>and before
he was able to rise,<a href="#footnote13_169"><sup>13</sup></a> Loch wounded him crosswise
through the breast, <a name="footnotetag14_169" id="footnotetag14_169" href="#footnote14_169"><sup>14</sup></a>so that the spear<a name="footnotetaga_169" id="footnotetaga_169" href="#footnotea_169"><sup>a</sup></a> went through him<a href="#footnote14_169"><sup>14</sup></a>
<a name="footnotetag15_169" id="footnotetag15_169" href="#footnote15_169"><sup>15</sup></a>and the ford was gore-red with his blood.<a href="#footnote15_169"><sup>15</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag16_169" id="footnotetag16_169" href="#footnote16_169"><sup>16</sup></a>&quot;Ill,
indeed,&quot; cried Fergus, &quot;is this deed in the face of the foe.
Let some of ye taunt him, ye men,&quot; he cried to his people,
&quot;to the end that he fall not in vain!&quot;</p>

<p>Bricriu Nemthenga ('Of the Venom-tongue') son of Carbad
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_170" name="Page_170" title="170">170</a>
arose and began to revile Cuchulain. &quot;Thy strength
has gone from thee,&quot; said he, &quot;when a little salmon overthrows
thee even now when the Ulstermen are about to
come out of their 'Pains.'<a name="footnotetag16_170" id="footnotetag16_170" href="#footnote16_169"><sup>16</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag1_170" id="footnotetag1_170" href="#footnote1_170"><sup>1</sup></a>Hard it would be for thee

The Morrigan next came in the form of a rough, grey-red

<a name="footnotetag12_170" id="footnotetag12_170" href="#footnote12_170"><sup>12</sup></a>and Cuchulain made a cast of his little javelin

sent the Gae Bulga down the stream and Cuchulain made
it ready. And when Loch heard that, he gave a lunge down
with his shield, so that he drove it over two-thirds deep
into the pebbles and sand and gravel of the ford. And then
Cuchulain let go the Barbed-spear upwards, so as to strike
Loch over the border of his hauberk and the rim of his
shield.<a href="#footnote1_171"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_171" id="footnotetag2_171" href="#footnote2_171"><sup>2</sup></a>And it pierced his body's covering, for Loch wore

<h2>XVII. THE GREAT ROUT ON THE PLAIN OF MURTHEMNE FOLLOWETH HERE BELOW</h2>


<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 2431.</span>
<a name="footnotetag1_180" id="footnotetag1_180" href="#footnote1_180"><sup>1</sup></a>That night<a href="#footnote1_180"><sup>1</sup></a> the warriors of four of the five grand provinces
of Erin pitched camp and made their station in the place
called Breslech Mor ('the Great Rout') in the Plain of Murthemne.
Their portion of cattle and spoils they sent on
before them to the south to the cow-stalls of Ulster. <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 76a.</span> Cuchulain
took station at Ferta ('the Gravemound') at Lerga
('the Slopes') hard by them. And his charioteer kindled
him a fire on the evening of that night, namely Laeg son
of Riangabair. Cuchulain saw far away in the distance the
fiery glitter of the bright-golden arms over the heads of
four of the five grand provinces of Erin, in the setting of the
sun in the clouds of evening. Great anger and rage possessed
him at their sight, because of the multitude of his
foes, because of the number of his enemies <a name="footnotetag2_180" id="footnotetag2_180" href="#footnote2_180"><sup>2</sup></a>and opponents,
and because of the few that were to avenge his sores and his
wounds upon them.<a href="#footnote2_180"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag3_180" id="footnotetag3_180" href="#footnote3_180"><sup>3</sup></a>Then Cuchulain arose and<a href="#footnote3_180"><sup>3</sup></a> he grasped his two spears
and his shield and his sword. He shook his shield and
brandished his spears and wielded his sword and sent out
the hero's shout from his throat, so that the fiends and
goblins and sprites of the glens and demons of the air gave
answer for the fearfulness of the shout <a name="footnotetag4_180" id="footnotetag4_180" href="#footnote4_180"><sup>4</sup></a>that he lifted on
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_181" name="Page_181" title="181">181</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2444.</span>
high,<a name="footnotetag4_181" id="footnotetag4_181" href="#footnote4_181"><sup>4</sup></a> until Nemain, <a name="footnotetag1_181" id="footnotetag1_181" href="#footnote1_181"><sup>1</sup></a>which is Badb,<a href="#footnote1_181"><sup>1</sup></a> brought confusion on
the host. The warriors of the four provinces of Erin made
such a clangour of arms with the points of their spears and
their weapons that an hundred <a name="footnotetag2_181" id="footnotetag2_181" href="#footnote2_181"><sup>2</sup></a>strong, stout-sturdy<a href="#footnote2_181"><sup>2</sup></a>
warriors of them fell dead that night of fright and of heartbreak
in the middle of the camp and quarters <a name="footnotetag3_181" id="footnotetag3_181" href="#footnote3_181"><sup>3</sup></a>of the men
of Erin at the awfulness of the horror and the shout which
Cuchulain lifted on high.<a href="#footnote3_181"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>As Laeg stood there he descried something: A single man
coming from the north-eastern quarter athwart the camp
of the four grand provinces of Erin making directly for
him. &quot;A single man here cometh towards us now, Cucucan,&quot;
cried Laeg. &quot;But what manner of man is he?&quot;
Cuchulain asked. &quot;Not hard to say,&quot; <a href="#footnote4_181"><sup>4</sup></a>Laeg made answer.<a href="#footnote4_181"><sup>4</sup></a>
&quot;A great, well-favoured man, then. Broad, close-shorn
hair upon him, and yellow and curly his back hair. A green
mantle wrapped around him. A brooch of white silver<a name="footnotetaga_181" id="footnotetaga_181" href="#footnotea_181"><sup>a</sup></a>
in the mantle over his breast. A kirtle of silk fit for a king,
with red interweaving of ruddy gold he wears trussed up
on his fair skin and reaching down to his knees. <a name="footnotetag5_181" id="footnotetag5_181" href="#footnote5_181"><sup>5</sup></a>A great
one-edged sword in his hand.<a href="#footnote5_181"><sup>5</sup></a> A black shield with hard
rim of silvered bronze thereon. A five-barbed spear in
his hand. A pronged bye-spear beside it. Marvellous, in
sooth, the feats and the sport and the play that he makes.
But him no one heeds, nor gives he heed to any one. <a name="footnotetag6_181" id="footnotetag6_181" href="#footnote6_181"><sup>6</sup></a>No
one shows him courtesy nor does he show courtesy to any
one,<a href="#footnote6_181"><sup>6</sup></a> like as if none saw him in the camp of the four
grand provinces of Erin.&quot; &quot;In sooth, O fosterling,&quot;
answered Cuchulain, &quot;it is one of my friends of fairy
kin <a name="footnotetag7_181" id="footnotetag7_181" href="#footnote7_181"><sup>7</sup></a>that comes<a href="#footnote7_181"><sup>7</sup></a> to take pity upon me, because they know
the great distress wherein I am now all alone against the
four grand provinces of Erin on the Plunder of the Kine of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_182" name="Page_182" title="182">182</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2463.</span>
Cualnge, <a name="footnotetag1_182" id="footnotetag1_182" href="#footnote1_182"><sup>1</sup></a>killing a man on the ford each day and fifty
each night, for the men of Erin grant me not fair fight nor
the terms of single combat from noon of each day.&quot;<a href="#footnote1_182"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Now in this, Cuchulain spoke truth. When the young
warrior was come up to Cuchulain he bespoke him and
condoled with him <a name="footnotetag2_182" id="footnotetag2_182" href="#footnote2_182"><sup>2</sup></a>for the greatness of his toil and the
length of time he had passed without sleep.<a href="#footnote2_182"><sup>2</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_182" id="footnotetag3_182" href="#footnote3_182"><sup>3</sup></a>&quot;This is
brave of thee, O Cuchulain,&quot; quoth he. &quot;It is not much,
at all,&quot; replied Cuchulain. &quot;But I will bring thee help,&quot;
said the young warrior. &quot;Who then art thou?&quot; asked
Cuchulain. &quot;Thy father from Faery am I, even Lug
son of Ethliu.&quot; &quot;Yea, heavy are the bloody wounds
upon me; let thy healing be speedy.&quot;<a href="#footnote3_182"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;Sleep then
awhile, O Cuchulain,&quot; said the young warrior, &quot;thy heavy
fit of sleep by Ferta in Lerga ('the Gravemound on the
Slopes') till the end of three days and three nights and I
will oppose the hosts during that time.&quot; <a name="footnotetag4_182" id="footnotetag4_182" href="#footnote4_182"><sup>4</sup></a>He examined
each wound so that it became clean. Then he sang him
the 'men's low strain' till Cuchulain fell asleep withal.
It was then Lug recited<a href="#footnote4_182"><sup>4</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag5_182" id="footnotetag5_182" href="#footnote5_182"><sup>5</sup></a>the Spell-chant of Lug.<a href="#footnote5_182"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Accordingly Cuchulain slept his heavy fit of sleep at
'the Gravemound on the Slopes' till the end of three
days and three nights. And well he might sleep. Yet
as great as was his sleep, even so great was his weariness.
For from the Monday before Samain<a name="footnotetaga_182" id="footnotetaga_182" href="#footnotea_182"><sup>a</sup></a> ('Summer-end')
even to the Wednesday after Spring-beginning,<a name="footnotetagb_182" id="footnotetagb_182" href="#footnoteb_182"><sup>b</sup></a> Cuchulain
slept not for all that space, except for a brief snatch
after mid-day, leaning against his spear, and his head on his

but hewing and cutting, slaying and destroying four of the
five grand provinces of Erin during that time.</p>

<p>Then it was that the warrior <a name="footnotetag1_183" id="footnotetag1_183" href="#footnote1_183"><sup>1</sup></a>from Faery<a href="#footnote1_183"><sup>1</sup></a> laid plants
from the fairy-rath and healing herbs and put a healing
charm into the cuts and stabs, into the sores and gaping
wounds of Cuchulain, so that Cuchulain recovered during
his sleep without ever perceiving it.</p>

<h2><span class="sc">XVIIa</span>. THE SLAUGHTER OF THE YOUTHS OF ULSTER<a name="footnotetaga_184" id="footnotetaga_184" href="#footnotea_184"><sup>a</sup></a></h2>


<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 2482.</span>
That was the time the youths came out of the north from
Emain Macha <a name="footnotetag1_184" id="footnotetag1_184" href="#footnote1_184"><sup>1</sup></a>to the help of Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote1_184"><sup>1</sup></a> Thrice fifty boys
of the sons of the kings of Ulster, accompanying Follomain,
Conchobar's son, and three battles they offered to the hosts,
so that thrice their number fell and the youths also fell,
save Conchobar's son Follomain. Follomain vowed that
never till the very day of doom and of life would he return
to Emain unless he should bring Ailill's head with him together
with the diadem of gold that was on it. That was
no easy thing for him to achieve, for the two sons of Beth&egrave;
son of Ban&mdash;the two sons of Ailill's foster-mother and foster-father
<a name="footnotetag2_184" id="footnotetag2_184" href="#footnote2_184"><sup>2</sup></a>to whom King Ailill's diadem had been entrusted<a href="#footnote2_184"><sup>2</sup></a>&mdash;attacked
and wounded <a name="footnotetag3_184" id="footnotetag3_184" href="#footnote3_184"><sup>3</sup></a>Follomain,<a href="#footnote3_184"><sup>3</sup></a> so that he fell by their
hands. This then is the Massacre of the youths of Ulster
and of Follomain son of Conchobar.</p>

<p>Touching Cuchulain, he remained in his sound, heavy
sleep till the end of three days and three nights at the 'Gravemound
on the Slopes.' Thereafter Cuchulain arose from
his sleep. He passed his hand over his face and he became
as a wild<a name="footnotetagb_184" id="footnotetagb_184" href="#footnoteb_184"><sup>b</sup></a> wheel-thunder (?) from his crown to the ground,
and he felt his courage strengthened, and he would have
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_185" name="Page_185" title="185">185</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2497.</span>
been able to go into an assembly or on a march or to a
tryst with a woman or to an ale-house or into one of the
chief assemblies of Erin. &quot;How long am I asleep now,
young warrior?&quot; Cuchulain asked. &quot;Three days and
three nights,&quot; the young warrior made answer. &quot;Woe
is me for that!&quot; quoth Cuchulain. &quot;Why so?&quot; asked
the young warrior. &quot;For that the hosts have not been
attacked in that time,&quot; answered Cuchulain. &quot;Nay, not
so were they spared,&quot; the young warrior made answer. &quot;I
would fain inquire who then attacked them?&quot; Cuchulain
asked. &quot;The youths came hither out of the north
from Emain Macha, thrice fifty boys accompanying Follomain,
Conchobar's son, and they the sons of the kings of
Ulster. And three battles they offered the hosts in the
space of the three days and three nights wherein thou wast
till now asleep, and thrice their number are fallen at their
hands and the youths themselves are fallen except Follomain
<a name="footnotetag1_185" id="footnotetag1_185" href="#footnote1_185"><sup>1</sup></a>alone,<a href="#footnote1_185"><sup>1</sup></a> Conchobar's son. And Follomain vowed
that never till the very day of doom and of life <a name="footnotetag3_185" id="footnotetag3_185" href="#footnote3_185"><sup>3</sup></a>would he
return <a name="footnotetag2_185" id="footnotetag2_185" href="#footnote2_185"><sup>2</sup></a>north<a href="#footnote2_185"><sup>2</sup></a> to Emain Macha till he carried off Ailill's
head with the diadem of gold which was on it. Howbeit
not such was his luck, for he fell at the hands of the two
sons of Beth&egrave; son of Ban, after engaging in battle with
them.&quot;<a href="#footnote3_185"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Alas, that I was not <a name="footnotetag4_185" id="footnotetag4_185" href="#footnote4_185"><sup>4</sup></a>there<a href="#footnote4_185"><sup>4</sup></a> in my strength!&quot;
cried Cuchulain; &quot;for had I been in my strength the
youths would not have fallen, as now they have, and
Follomain would not have perished.&quot; &quot;But this avow,
O Cucan,&quot;<a name="footnotetaga_185" id="footnotetaga_185" href="#footnotea_185"><sup>a</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag5_185" id="footnotetag5_185" href="#footnote5_185"><sup>5</sup></a>said the young warrior;<a href="#footnote5_185"><sup>5</sup></a> &quot;it is no reproach
to thine honour and no disgrace to thy valour.&quot;
&quot;Bide here this night with us, young warrior,&quot; said
Cuchulain, &quot;that together we avenge the youths on the
hosts.&quot; &quot;Nay then, I may not tarry,&quot; answered the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_186" name="Page_186" title="186">186</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2515.</span>
young warrior. <a name="footnotetag1_186" id="footnotetag1_186" href="#footnote1_186"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;Why so?&quot; asked Cuchulain. &quot;Easy
to say,&quot; replied the young warrior;<a href="#footnote1_186"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;for however prodigious
the deeds of valour and skill in arms one may perform
in thy company, not on him will fall the glory nor the honour
nor the fame but on thyself. For this reason will I not
tarry with thee, but do thou thyself try thy feats of arms
<a name="footnotetag2_186" id="footnotetag2_186" href="#footnote2_186"><sup>2</sup></a>and the strength of thy hands<a href="#footnote2_186"><sup>2</sup></a> alone on the hosts, for not
with them is the power over thy life on this occasion.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag3_186" id="footnotetag3_186" href="#footnote3_186"><sup>3</sup></a>Then the young warrior from Faery went from him
and they knew not what way he had gone. &quot;Good, O my
master Laeg,&quot; said Cuchulain; &quot;together we will go to
avenge the youths on the hosts.&quot; &quot;I will go with thee,&quot;
Laeg made answer.<a href="#footnote3_186"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;And the scythed chariot, my friend
Laeg,&quot; said Cuchulain. &quot;Canst thou get it ready? If
thou canst get it ready and hast its equipment, make it
ready, and if its equipment is not at hand, make it not
ready.&quot;</p>

<h2><span class="sc">XVIIb</span>. THE SCYTHED CHARIOT</h2>


<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 2525.</span>
Thereupon the charioteer arose and donned his yeoman's
suit for charioteering. Of this <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 77a.</span> yeoman's suit for charioteering,
this is what he put on him: His soft kirtle of skin
which was light and airy, which was smooth and sparkling,
which was stitched and of buckskin, so that it hindered
not the movements of his arms outside. Over that he put
outside an over-mantle of raven's feathers, which Simon
Magus had made <a name="footnotetag1_187" id="footnotetag1_187" href="#footnote1_187"><sup>1</sup></a>as a gift<a href="#footnote1_187"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_187" id="footnotetag2_187" href="#footnote2_187"><sup>2</sup></a>for Darius<a href="#footnote2_187"><sup>2</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_187" id="footnotetag3_187" href="#footnote3_187"><sup>3</sup></a>Nero,<a href="#footnote3_187"><sup>3</sup></a> king
of the Romans. Darius bestowed it upon Conchobar; Conchobar
gave it to Cuchulain; Cuchulain presented it to
<a name="footnotetag4_187" id="footnotetag4_187" href="#footnote4_187"><sup>4</sup></a>Laeg son of Riangabair,<a href="#footnote4_187"><sup>4</sup></a> his charioteer. The same
charioteer took the crested, plated, four-bordered battle-cap
with variety of every colour and every figure, reaching
<a name="footnotetag5_187" id="footnotetag5_187" href="#footnote5_187"><sup>5</sup></a>down<a href="#footnote5_187"><sup>5</sup></a> over the middle of his shoulders behind. It was
an adornment for him and not an encumbrance. With
his hand he placed the red-yellow frontlet&mdash;like one red-golden
strip of glowing gold smelted over the edge of an
anvil&mdash;on his forehead as a token of charioteering, to
distinguish him from his master. He opened the hobbles
that fastened his steeds and grasped his gold-mounted
goad in his right hand. In his left hand he seized the lines,
that is, the bridle-reins of his horses for restraining his
steeds before performing his charioteering.</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_188" name="Page_188" title="188">188</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 2542.</span>
He next threw the iron-sheathed gold-bedecked coats
of mail over his horses, so that they covered them from forehead
to forehand. <a name="footnotetag1_188" id="footnotetag1_188" href="#footnote1_188"><sup>1</sup></a>The chariot was<a href="#footnote1_188"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_188" id="footnotetag2_188" href="#footnote2_188"><sup>2</sup></a>studded with<a href="#footnote2_188"><sup>2</sup></a>
dartlets, lancelets, spearlets, and hardened spits, so that
every portion of the frame bristled with points in that
chariot and every corner and end and point and face of that
chariot was a passage of laceration.</p>

<p>Then cast he a spell of concealment over his horses and
over his fellow, so that they were not visible to any one in
the camp, while all in the camp were visible to them, <a name="footnotetag3_188" id="footnotetag3_188" href="#footnote3_188"><sup>3</sup></a>and
over this veil of protection he wounded each one and
through it and behind it.<a href="#footnote3_188"><sup>3</sup></a> Well indeed was it that he cast
that charm, for on that day the charioteer had to perform
the three gifts of charioteership, namely leaping over a
cleft in the ranks, unerring driving, and the handling of the
goad.</p>

<p>Then <a name="footnotetag4_188" id="footnotetag4_188" href="#footnote4_188"><sup>4</sup></a>arose<a href="#footnote4_188"><sup>4</sup></a> the champion and battle-warrior and the
instrument of Badb's corpse-fold<a name="footnotetaga_188" id="footnotetaga_188" href="#footnotea_188"><sup>a</sup></a> among the men of the
earth,<a name="footnotetagc_188" id="footnotetagc_188" href="#footnotec_188"><sup>c</sup></a> Cuchulain son of Sualtaim, and he donned his
war-dress of battle and fight and combat. To that war-dress
of battle and fight and combat which he put about
him belonged seven and twenty<a name="footnotetagb_188" id="footnotetagb_188" href="#footnoteb_188"><sup>b</sup></a> waxed, board-like,
equally close skin-tunics which were girded by cords and
swathings and ropes on his fair skin, to the end that his
wit and reason might not become deranged when the
violence of his nature came over him.</p>

<p>Over him he put on the outside his battle-girdle of a
champion, of tough, tanned, stout leather cut from the forequarters
of seven ox-hides of yearlings, so that it reached
from the slender parts of his waist to the stout part under
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_189" name="Page_189" title="189">189</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2562.</span>
his arm-pits. He was used to wear it to keep off spears and
points and irons and lances and arrows. For in like manner
they would bound back from it as if from stone or rock or
horn they rebounded. Then he took his silken, glossy
trews with their band of spotted pale-gold against the soft
lower parts of his loins. His brown, well-sewn kilt of brown
leather from the shoulders of four ox-hides of yearlings,
with his battle-girdle of cow-skins, he put underneath over
the shining silken trews on the outside, <a name="footnotetag1_189" id="footnotetag1_189" href="#footnote1_189"><sup>1</sup></a>so that it covered
him from the slender part of his waist to the thick part of
his thighs and reached up to the battle-belt of the hero.<a href="#footnote1_189"><sup>1</sup></a>
Then the king-hero <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 77a.</span> <a name="footnotetag2_189" id="footnotetag2_189" href="#footnote2_189"><sup>2</sup></a>and king-warrior<a href="#footnote2_189"><sup>2</sup></a> seized his battle-arms
of battle and fight and combat. This is what belonged
to those warlike weapons of battle: He took his
eight little swords together with the bright-faced, tusk-hilted
straightsword <a name="footnotetag3_189" id="footnotetag3_189" href="#footnote3_189"><sup>3</sup></a>along with his quiver;<a href="#footnote3_189"><sup>3</sup></a> he took
his eight little spears besides his five-pronged spear; he
took his eight little darts together with his javelin with
its walrus-tooth ornaments; he took his eight little shafts
along with his play-staff; he took his eight shields for
feats together with his dark-red bent-shield, whereon a
show-boar could lie in its hollow boss, with its very sharp,
razor-like, keen-cutting, hard <a name="footnotetag4_189" id="footnotetag4_189" href="#footnote4_189"><sup>4</sup></a>iron<a href="#footnote4_189"><sup>4</sup></a> rim all around it, so
that it would cut a hair against the stream because of its
sharpness and fineness and keenness. When the young
warrior would perform the edge-feat withal, it was the
same whether he cut with his shield or his spear or his
sword. Next he put round his head his crested war-helm
of battle and fight and combat, <a name="footnotetag5_189" id="footnotetag5_189" href="#footnote5_189"><sup>5</sup></a>wherein were four carbuncle-gems
on each point and each end to adorn it,<a href="#footnote5_189"><sup>5</sup></a> whereout
was uttered the cry of an hundred young warriors with
the long-drawn wail from each of its angles and corners.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_190" name="Page_190" title="190">190</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2583.</span>
For this was the way that the fiends, the goblins and the
sprites of the glens and the demons of the air screamed
before and above and around him, what time he went forth
for the shedding of blood of heroes and champions, <a name="footnotetag1_190" id="footnotetag1_190" href="#footnote1_190"><sup>1</sup></a>exulting
in the mighty deeds wrought underneath it<a href="#footnote1_190"><sup>1</sup></a>. His
veil of concealment was thrown over him then, of raiment
from Tir Tairngir&egrave; ('the Land of Promise') which had been
brought to him <a name="footnotetag2_190" id="footnotetag2_190" href="#footnote2_190"><sup>2</sup></a>as a gift<a href="#footnote2_190"><sup>2</sup></a> by Manannan son of Ler ('the
Sea') from the king of Tir na Sorcha ('the Land of Light'),
<a name="footnotetag3_190" id="footnotetag3_190" href="#footnote3_190"><sup>3</sup></a>his foster-father in magic<a href="#footnote3_190"><sup>3</sup></a>. <a name="footnotetag4_190" id="footnotetag4_190" href="#footnote4_190"><sup>4</sup></a>His fair, purple-red fan was
placed in front of his face. Past it and through it and over
it everything was visible to him and no one wounded him
past it nor through it nor over it<a href="#footnote4_190"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Then took place the first twisting-fit <a name="footnotetag5_190" id="footnotetag5_190" href="#footnote5_190"><sup>5</sup></a>and rage<a href="#footnote5_190"><sup>5</sup></a> of
<a name="footnotetag6_190" id="footnotetag6_190" href="#footnote6_190"><sup>6</sup></a>the royal hero<a href="#footnote6_190"><sup>6</sup></a> Cuchulain, so that he made a terrible,
many-shaped, wonderful, unheard of thing of himself.
His flesh trembled about him like a pole against the torrent
or like a bulrush against the stream, every member and
every joint and every point and every knuckle of him
from crown to ground. He made a mad whirling-feat of
his body within his hide. His feet and his shins and his
knees slid so that they came behind him. His heels and
his calves and his hams shifted so that they passed to the
front. The muscles of his calves moved so that they came
to the front of his shins, so that each huge knot was the size
of a soldier's balled fist. He stretched the sinews of his
head so that they stood out on the nape of his neck,
and as large as the head of a month-old child was each
of the hill-like lumps, huge, incalculable, vast, immeasurable.</p>

<p>He next made a ruddy bowl of his face and his countenance.
He gulped down one eye into his head so that it
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_191" name="Page_191" title="191">191</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2603.</span>
would be hard work if a wild crane succeeded in drawing it
out on to the middle of his cheek from the rear of his skull.
Its mate sprang forth till it came out on his cheek, <a name="footnotetag1_191" id="footnotetag1_191" href="#footnote1_191"><sup>1</sup></a>so that
it was the size of a five-fist kettle, and he made a red berry
thereof out in front of his head.<a href="#footnote1_191"><sup>1</sup></a> His mouth was distorted
monstrously <a name="footnotetag2_191" id="footnotetag2_191" href="#footnote2_191"><sup>2</sup></a>and twisted up to his ears<a href="#footnote2_191"><sup>2</sup></a>. He drew the
cheek from the jaw-bone so that the interior of his throat
was to be seen. His lungs and his lights stood out so that
they fluttered in his mouth and his gullet. He struck a
mad lion's blow with the upper jaw <a name="footnotetag3_191" id="footnotetag3_191" href="#footnote3_191"><sup>3</sup></a>on its fellow<a href="#footnote3_191"><sup>3</sup></a> so that as
large as a wether's fleece of a three year old was each <a name="footnotetag4_191" id="footnotetag4_191" href="#footnote4_191"><sup>4</sup></a>red,<a href="#footnote4_191"><sup>4</sup></a>
fiery flake <a name="footnotetag5_191" id="footnotetag5_191" href="#footnote5_191"><sup>5</sup></a>which his teeth forced<a href="#footnote5_191"><sup>5</sup></a> into his mouth from
his gullet. There was heard the loud clap of his heart
against his breast like the yelp of a howling bloodhound
or like a lion going among bears. <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 78a.</span> There were seen the
<a name="footnotetaga_191" id="footnotetaga_191" href="#footnotea_191"><sup>a</sup></a>torches of the Badb,<a href="#footnotea_191"><sup>a</sup></a> and the rain clouds of poison,
and the sparks of glowing-red fire, <a name="footnotetag6_191" id="footnotetag6_191" href="#footnote6_191"><sup>6</sup></a>blazing and flashing<a href="#footnote6_191"><sup>6</sup></a>
in hazes and mists over his head with the seething of the truly-wild
wrath that rose up above him. His hair bristled all
over his head like branches of a redthorn thrust into a gap in a
great hedge. Had a king's apple-tree laden with royal fruit
been shaken around him, scarce an apple of them all would
have passed over him to the ground, but rather would an
apple have stayed stuck on each single hair there, for
the twisting of the anger which met it as it rose from his
hair above him. The Lon Laith ('Champion's Light') stood
out of his forehead, so that it was as long and as thick as a
warrior's whetstone, <a name="footnotetag7_191" id="footnotetag7_191" href="#footnote7_191"><sup>7</sup></a>so that it was as long as his nose,
till he got furious handling the shields, thrusting out the
charioteer, destroying the hosts.<a href="#footnote7_191"><sup>7</sup></a> As high, as thick, as
strong, as steady, as long as the sail-tree of some huge

prime ship was the straight spout of dark blood which arose
right on high from the very ridgepole of his crown, so that
a black fog of witchery was made thereof like to the smoke
from a king's hostel what time the king comes to be ministered
to at nightfall of a winter's day.</p>

<p>When now this contortion had been completed in Cuchulain,
then it was that the hero of valour sprang into his
scythed war-chariot, with its iron sickles, its thin blades,
its hooks and its hard spikes, with its hero's fore-prongs,
with its opening fixtures, with its stinging nails that were
fastened to the poles and thongs and bows and lines of the
chariot, <a name="footnotetag1_192" id="footnotetag1_192" href="#footnote1_192"><sup>1</sup></a>lacerating heads and bones and bodies, legs and
necks and shoulders.<a href="#footnote1_192"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>It was then he delivered <a name="footnotetag2_192" id="footnotetag2_192" href="#footnote2_192"><sup>2</sup></a>over his chariot<a href="#footnote2_192"><sup>2</sup></a> the thunder-feat
of a hundred and the thunder-feat of two hundred and
the thunder-feat of three hundred and the thunder-feat
of four hundred, and he ceased at the thunder-feat of five
hundred. For he did not deem it too much that such a
great number should fall by his hand at his first onset and
first battle-assault on four of the five grand provinces of
Erin, <a name="footnotetag3_192" id="footnotetag3_192" href="#footnote3_192"><sup>3</sup></a>while avenging on them the slaughter of the youths
and of Follomain son of Conchobar,<a href="#footnote3_192"><sup>3</sup></a> In such wise fared
he forth for to seek his foes, and he drove his chariot in a
wide circuit round about the hosts of the four grand provinces
of Erin. And he led his chariot a heavy way. The
chariot's iron wheels sank into the ground so that <a name="footnotetag4_192" id="footnotetag4_192" href="#footnote4_192"><sup>4</sup></a>the earth
dug up by the iron wheels<a href="#footnote4_192"><sup>4</sup></a> might have served for a d&ucirc;n
and a fortress, so did the chariot's iron wheels cut into the
ground. For in like manner the clods and boulders and
rocks and the clumps and the shingle of the earth arose
up outside on a height with the iron wheels. It was for
this cause he made this circling <a name="footnotetag5_192" id="footnotetag5_192" href="#footnote5_192"><sup>5</sup></a>hedge<a href="#footnote5_192"><sup>5</sup></a> of the Badb
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_193" name="Page_193" title="193">193</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2646.</span>
round about the hosts of four of the five grand provinces of
Erin, that they might not escape him nor get away before
he would come on them to press a reprisal for the
boys. And he went into the midst of the ranks and
mowed down huge walls of the corpses of his foes <a name="footnotetag1_193" id="footnotetag1_193" href="#footnote1_193"><sup>1</sup></a>and
enemies and opponents<a href="#footnote1_193"><sup>1</sup></a> in a great circle round about the
host. And he made the onslaught of a foe amongst foes
upon them, so that they fell sole to sole, neck to neck, <a name="footnotetag2_193" id="footnotetag2_193" href="#footnote2_193"><sup>2</sup></a>arm
to arm, elbow to elbow, and rib to rib, <a name="footnotetag3_193" id="footnotetag3_193" href="#footnote3_193"><sup>3</sup></a>such was the closeness
of their bodies,<a href="#footnote3_193"><sup>3</sup></a> and there were pools of ruddy blood
where they moved.<a href="#footnote2_193"><sup>2</sup></a> Thrice again in this manner he circled
them round, so that he left them in beds of six in a great
ring around them, even the soles of three to the backs of
three men in a circle around the camp. Hence Sessrech
Breslig&egrave; ('Great sixfold Slaughter')<a name="footnotetaga_193" id="footnotetaga_193" href="#footnotea_193"><sup>a</sup></a> is the name of this
event on the T&aacute;in, and it is one of the three unreckonable
events of the T&aacute;in, which were, to wit, Sessrech Breslig&egrave;,
Immslig&egrave; Glennamnach ('the Mutual Slaying at Glennamain'),
and the battle of Garech <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 78b.</span> and Ilgarech; only that
here, hound and horse and man were one to him <a name="footnotetag4_193" id="footnotetag4_193" href="#footnote4_193"><sup>4</sup></a>in the
great rout on Mag Murthemni that night avenging the

Cuchulain's side at the Sessrech Breslig&egrave;.</p>

Cuchulain laid low in the great slaughter on the Plain of
Murthemne, besides a countless horde of dogs and horses
and women and boys and children and common folk; for
there escaped not a third man of the men of Erin <a name="footnotetag4_194" id="footnotetag4_194" href="#footnote4_194"><sup>4</sup></a>without
a wound or a hurt or a blueing or a reddening or a lump or

or without an enduring mark for the course of his life. <a name="footnotetag5_194" id="footnotetag5_194" href="#footnote5_194"><sup>5</sup></a>And

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 2706.</span>
<a name="footnotetag2_195" id="footnotetag2_195" href="#footnote2_195"><sup>2</sup></a>Early<a href="#footnote2_195"><sup>2</sup></a> the next morning Cuchulain came to observe
the host and to display his comely, beautiful form to the
matrons and dames and girls and maidens and poets and
men of art,<a name="footnotetaga_195" id="footnotetaga_195" href="#footnotea_195"><sup>a</sup></a> for he did not consider it an honour nor becoming,
the <a name="footnotetag3_195" id="footnotetag3_195" href="#footnote3_195"><sup>3</sup></a>wild,<a href="#footnote3_195"><sup>3</sup></a> proud shape of magic which had been manifested
to them the night before. It was for that then that
he came to exhibit his comely, beautiful form on that day.</p>

<p>Truly fair was the youth that came there to display his
form to the hosts, Cuchulain, to wit son of Sualtaim <a name="footnotetag4_195" id="footnotetag4_195" href="#footnote4_195"><sup>4</sup></a>son
of Boefoltach ('Of little possessions') son of Morfoltach
('Of great possessions') son of Red Neil macRudhraidi.<a href="#footnote4_195"><sup>4</sup></a>
Three heads of hair he wore; brown at the skin, blood-red
in the middle, a golden-yellow crown what thatched it.
Beautiful was the arrangement of the hair, with three coils
of hair wound round the nape of his neck, so that like to a
strand of thread of gold was each thread-like, loose-flowing,
deep-golden, magnificent, long-tressed, splendid, beauteous-hued
hair as it fell down over his shoulders. A hundred
bright-purple windings of gold-flaming red gold at his neck.
A hundred salmon-coloured (?) cords strung with carbuncles
as a covering round his head. Four spots on either of his two
cheeks, even a yellow spot, and a green spot, and a blue spot,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_196" name="Page_196" title="196">196</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2722.</span>
and a purple spot. Seven jewels of the eye's brilliance was
either of his kingly eyes. Seven toes to either of his two
feet. Seven fingers to either of his two hands, with the
clutch of hawk's claw, with the grip of hedgehog's talon in
every separate one of them.</p>

<p>He also put on him that day his fair-day dress. To
this apparel about him belonged, namely, a beautiful, well-fitting,
purple, fringed, five-folded mantle. A white brooch
of <a name="footnotetag1_196" id="footnotetag1_196" href="#footnote1_196"><sup>1</sup></a>silvered bronze or of<a href="#footnote1_196"><sup>1</sup></a> white silver incrusted with burnished
gold over his fair white breast, as if it were a full-fulgent
lantern that eyes of men could not behold <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 79a.</span> for its
resplendence and crystal shining. A <a name="footnotetag2_196" id="footnotetag2_196" href="#footnote2_196"><sup>2</sup></a>striped<a href="#footnote2_196"><sup>2</sup></a> chest-jacket
of silk on his skin, fairly adorned with borders and
braidings and trimmings of gold and silver and silvered
bronze; it reached to the upper hem of his dark, brown-red
warlike breeches of royal silk. A magnificent, brown-purple
buckler he bore, <a name="footnotetag3_196" id="footnotetag3_196" href="#footnote3_196"><sup>3</sup></a>with five wheels of gold on it,<a href="#footnote3_196"><sup>3</sup></a>
with a rim of pure white silver around it. A gold-hilted
hammered sword <a name="footnotetag4_196" id="footnotetag4_196" href="#footnote4_196"><sup>4</sup></a>with ivory guards, raised high at his
girdle<a href="#footnote4_196"><sup>4</sup></a> at his left side. A long grey-edged spear together
with a trenchant bye-spear for defence, with thongs for
throwing and with rivets of whitened bronze, alongside him
in the chariot. Nine heads he bore in one of his hands and
ten in the other, and these he brandished before the hosts
in token of his prowess and cunning. <a name="footnotetag5_196" id="footnotetag5_196" href="#footnote5_196"><sup>5</sup></a>This then was a
night's attack for Cuchulain on the hosts of four of the five
provinces of Erin.<a href="#footnote5_196"><sup>5</sup></a> Medb hid her face beneath a shelter
of shields lest Cuchulain should cast at her that day.</p>

<p>Then it was that the maidens <a name="footnotetag6_196" id="footnotetag6_196" href="#footnote6_196"><sup>6</sup></a>of Connacht<a href="#footnote6_196"><sup>6</sup></a> besought
the men of Erin to lift them up on the flat of the shields
above the warriors' shoulders; <a name="footnotetag7_196" id="footnotetag7_196" href="#footnote7_196"><sup>7</sup></a>and the women <a name="footnotetag8_196" id="footnotetag8_196" href="#footnote8_196"><sup>8</sup></a>of
Munster<a href="#footnote8_196"><sup>8</sup></a> clomb on the men<a href="#footnote7_196"><sup>7</sup></a> to behold the aspect of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_197" name="Page_197" title="197">197</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2746.</span>
Cuchulain. For they marvelled at the beautiful, comely
appearance he showed them that day compared with the
low, arrogant shape of magic in which they had seen him
the night before.</p>

<p>Fergus macRoig heard this and he deemed it an outrage
that Dubthach should counsel how to betray Cuchulain to
the hosts. And he reached him a strong, sharp kick with his
foot away from him, so that Dubthach struck with his mouth
against the group outside. And Fergus reproached him
for all the wrongs and iniquities and treachery and shameful
deeds he had ever done to the Ulstermen of old and anew.

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 2814.</span>
Then it was that a very bold young warrior of the Ulstermen
came nigh the hosts; his bye-name was Oengus son of
Oenlam Gab&egrave; ('the One-handed Smith'). And he drove the
hosts before him from Moda Loga, which at that time was
called Lugmud, to Ath da Fert ('the Ford of the Two
Gravemounds') in Sliab Fuait. <a name="footnotetag2_201" id="footnotetag2_201" href="#footnote2_201"><sup>2</sup></a>And he suffered them not
to go by, but he showered them with stones.<a href="#footnote2_201"><sup>2</sup></a> What scholars
say is: If Oengus son of Oenlam Gab&egrave; had fought them in
single combat, <a name="footnotetag3_201" id="footnotetag3_201" href="#footnote3_201"><sup>3</sup></a>two-thirds of<a href="#footnote3_201"><sup>3</sup></a> the host would have fallen

Howbeit it was by no means so that they acted, but they
attacked him from ambush on every side, till he fell at their
hands <a name="footnotetag5_201" id="footnotetag5_201" href="#footnote5_201"><sup>5</sup></a>in unequal fight<a href="#footnote5_201"><sup>5</sup></a> at Ath da Fert in Sliab Fuait.</p>

<h2><span class="sc">XVIIIa</span>. HERE NOW IS TOLD THE MISTHROW AT BELACH EOIN.</h2>


<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 2823.</span>
Then came to them Fiacha Fialdana ('the Generous and
Intrepid') of the Ulstermen to speak with the son of his
mother's sister, namely with Man&egrave; Ando&egrave; ('the Unslow')
of the Connachtmen. And thus he came, and Dubthach
Doel ('the Black Tongue') of Ulster with him. It was in this
wise that Man&egrave; Ando&egrave; came, and Doch&egrave; son of Maga along
with him. When now Doch&egrave; macMagach espied Fiacha
Fialdana, he straightway hurled a spear at him, but so
that it went through his own friend, through Dubthach
Doel of Ulster. Then Fiacha Fialdana hurled a spear at
Doch&egrave; macMagach, so that it went through his own friend,
through Man&egrave; Ando&egrave; of Connacht. Thereupon said the
men of Erin: &quot;A mishap in throwing,&quot; they said, &quot;is
what hath happened to the men, for each of them to kill
his friend and nearest relation.&quot; Hence this is entitled
Imroll Belaig Eoin ('the Misthrow at Bird-pass'). And
'the Other Misthrow at Bird-pass' is another name for it.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag1_202" id="footnotetag1_202" href="#footnote1_202"><sup>1</sup></a>Or it may be this from which cometh Imroll Belaig
Eoin: The hosts proceed to Belach Eoin ('Bird-pass').
Their two troops wait there. Diarmait macConchobar
of the Ulstermen comes from the north. &quot;Let a horseman
start from you,&quot; cries Diarmait, &quot;that Man&egrave; may
come with one man to parley with me, and I will go with
another man to parley with him.&quot; A while thereafter they
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_203" name="Page_203" title="203">203</a>
meet &quot;I am come,&quot; says Diarmait, &quot;from Conchobar,
with commands to Ailill and Medb that they let the cows
go and make good all the ill they have done here and bring
hither the bull<a name="footnotetaga_203" id="footnotetaga_203" href="#footnotea_203"><sup>a</sup></a> from the west to meet the other bull,<a name="footnotetagb_203" id="footnotetagb_203" href="#footnoteb_203"><sup>b</sup></a>
to the end that they may encounter, since Medb has pledged
it.&quot; &quot;I will go,&quot; says Man&egrave;, &quot;to tell them.&quot; He takes
this message to Medb and Ailill. &quot;This cannot be had
of Medb,&quot; Man&egrave; reported. &quot;Let us make a fair exchange
of arms, then,&quot; says Diarmait, &quot;if perchance that pleaseth
thee better.&quot; &quot;I am content,&quot; replies Man&egrave;. Each of
them casts his spear at the other so that both of them
die, and hence the name of this place is Imroll Belaig
Eoin. Their forces rush upon one another. Three-score of
each force fall. Hence is Ard in Dirma ('the Height of the
Troop').<a name="footnotetag1_203" id="footnotetag1_203" href="#footnote1_202"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h2><span class="sc">XVIIIb</span>. HERE NOW FOLLOWETH THE DISGUISING OF TAMON</h2>


<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 2837.</span>
Then said the men of Erin to Tamon the fool that he should
don the garments of Ailill and the king's golden shawl, and go
to the ford that was close before them. So he put the garments
and golden shawl of Ailill upon him. <a name="footnotetag1_204" id="footnotetag1_204" href="#footnote1_204"><sup>1</sup></a>Ailill's people placed
the king's diadem on the head of Tamon the fool, for Ailill
dared not wear it himself,<a href="#footnote1_204"><sup>1</sup></a> and he went on to the ford under
their eyes. The men of Erin began to scoff and to shout and
jeer at him. &quot;It is a disguising of Tamon ('a Stump') for
thee, O Tamon the fool,&quot; they cried, &quot;with the dress and the
golden shawl of Ailill upon thee!&quot; When Cuchulain saw
him, it seemed to him in his ignorance and lack of knowledge
that it was Ailill himself that was there. And he slung a
stone from his staff-sling at him so that <a name="footnotetag2_204" id="footnotetag2_204" href="#footnote2_204"><sup>2</sup></a>his head was
broken thereby<a href="#footnote2_204"><sup>2</sup></a> and Tamon the fool was smitten lifeless
where he was on the ford. Hence Ath Tamuin ('the Ford
of a Stump') <a name="footnotetag3_204" id="footnotetag3_204" href="#footnote3_204"><sup>3</sup></a>is the name of that ford ever since<a href="#footnote3_204"><sup>3</sup></a> and 'the

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 2851.</span>
The hosts of the four grand provinces of Erin pitched camp
and entrenched themselves for that night at the pillar-stone
in Crich Roiss ('the Borders of Ross'). Then Medb
called upon the men of Erin for one of them to contend
and do battle with Cuchulain on the morrow. And every
one of them spake thus: &quot;It shall not be I! it shall not
be I!&quot; <a name="footnotetag2_205" id="footnotetag2_205" href="#footnote2_205"><sup>2</sup></a>cried each from his place.<a href="#footnote2_205"><sup>2</sup></a> &quot;No victim is owing
from my people, <a name="footnotetag3_205" id="footnotetag3_205" href="#footnote3_205"><sup>3</sup></a>and even if one were it would not be myself

murmured sore that Fergus foreswore her combat and
battle. <a name="footnotetag1_206" id="footnotetag1_206" href="#footnote1_206"><sup>1</sup></a>They filled him with wine till he was heavily
drunken and then they questioned him about going to the

&quot;A vain surety <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 80a.</span> is the one wherewith my master Fergus
comes to me; for no sword is in the sheath of the great
staff he bears.&quot; It was true what he said. A year before
this tale,<a name="footnotetaga_206" id="footnotetaga_206" href="#footnotea_206"><sup>a</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag7_206" id="footnotetag7_206" href="#footnote7_206"><sup>7</sup></a>before the expedition of the T&aacute;in,<a href="#footnote7_206"><sup>7</sup></a> Ailill had
found Fergus going to a tryst with Medb on the hillside in
Cruachan and his sword on a <a name="footnotetag8_206" id="footnotetag8_206" href="#footnote8_206"><sup>8</sup></a>branch<a href="#footnote8_206"><sup>8</sup></a> near by him. And
Ailill had torn the sword from its sheath and put a wooden
sword in its stead and vowed he would not restore him
the sword till came the day of the great battle, <a name="footnotetag9_206" id="footnotetag9_206" href="#footnote9_206"><sup>9</sup></a>when
the men of Erin would clash in the great battle of the Cualnge

Fergus, without thy sword.&quot;<a href="#footnote10_206"><sup>10</sup></a> &quot;It matters not to me,
O fosterling,&quot; replied Fergus; &quot;for had I a sword in this,
it never would cut thee nor be plied on thee. But, by

<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2874.</span>
the honour and training I bestowed upon thee and the

am loath <a name="footnotetag2_207" id="footnotetag2_207" href="#footnote2_207"><sup>2</sup></a>to do that,&quot;<a href="#footnote2_207"><sup>2</sup></a> answered Cuchulain, &quot;to flee
before any one man on the Cattle-spoil of Cualnge.&quot; &quot;Nay
then it is not a thing to be taken amiss by thee,&quot; said Fergus;
&quot;for I in my turn will retreat before thee when thou wilt
be covered with wounds and dripping with gore and pierced
with holes in the battle of the T&aacute;in. And when I alone shall
turn in flight <a name="footnotetag3_207" id="footnotetag3_207" href="#footnote3_207"><sup>3</sup></a>before thee,<a href="#footnote3_207"><sup>3</sup></a> so will all the men of Erin

Cuchulain to do whatever made for Ulster's weal that
he had his chariot brought to him, and he mounted his

<h2><span class="sc">XIXa</span>. HERE NOW COMETH THE HEAD-PLACE OF FERCHU</h2>


<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 2893.</span>
Ferchu Longsech ('the Exile'), <a name="footnotetag1_209" id="footnotetag1_209" href="#footnote1_209"><sup>1</sup></a>a wonderful warrior
from Loch Ce, outlawed from his land by Ailill and Medb,<a href="#footnote1_209"><sup>1</sup></a>
although of the Connachtmen, was engaged in battle and
plunder with Ailill and Medb. From the day these came
to the kingship, there never was a time that he fared to
their camp or took part in their expeditions or shared in
their straits or their needs or their hardships, but he was ever
at their heels, pillaging and plundering their borders and land.
At that time he sojourned in the eastern part of Mag Ai.
Twelve<a name="footnotetaga_209" id="footnotetaga_209" href="#footnotea_209"><sup>a</sup></a> men was his muster. He learned that a single
man checked and stopped four of the five grand provinces
of Erin from Monday at Summer's end till the beginning
of Spring, slaying a man on the ford every one of
those days and a hundred warriors every night. He weighed
his plan privily with his people. &quot;What better plan could
we devise?&quot; quoth he, &quot;than to go and attack yonder man
that checketh and stoppeth four of the five grand provinces
of Erin, and bring his head and his arms with us to Ailill
and Medb? However great the injuries and wrongs we
have done to Ailill and Medb, we shall obtain our peace
therefor, if only that man fall by our hand.&quot; <a name="footnotetag2_209" id="footnotetag2_209" href="#footnote2_209"><sup>2</sup></a>He made
no doubt that if Cuchulain fell through him, the eastern
territory of Connacht would be his.<a href="#footnote2_209"><sup>2</sup></a> Now this was the

was <a name="footnotetag1_210" id="footnotetag1_210" href="#footnote1_210"><sup>1</sup></a>at Ath Aladh ('Speckled Ford') on the Plain of

fight nor combat with one they vouchsafed him, but at one
and the same time the twelve men fell upon him <a name="footnotetag3_210" id="footnotetag3_210" href="#footnote3_210"><sup>3</sup></a>so that
their spears sank up to their middles into his shield.<a href="#footnote3_210"><sup>3</sup></a> Cuchulain
on his part <a name="footnotetag4_210" id="footnotetag4_210" href="#footnote4_210"><sup>4</sup></a>drew his sword from the sheath of
the Badb to attack them, and he fell to to cut away their
weapons and to lighten his shield. Then he<a href="#footnote4_210"><sup>4</sup></a> turned on
them, <a name="footnotetag5_210" id="footnotetag5_210" href="#footnote5_210"><sup>5</sup></a>front and back, to the left and the right,<a href="#footnote5_210"><sup>5</sup></a> and
straightway he smote off their twelve heads; <a name="footnotetag6_210" id="footnotetag6_210" href="#footnote6_210"><sup>6</sup></a>and he
engaged in a furious, bloody and violent battle with Ferchu
himself, after killing his people. And not long did it avail
Ferchu thus, for he fell at last by Cuchulain,<a href="#footnote6_210"><sup>6</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag7_210" id="footnotetag7_210" href="#footnote7_210"><sup>7</sup></a>and Cuchulain
cut off Ferchu's head to the east of the ford.<a href="#footnote7_210"><sup>7</sup></a>
And he set up twelve stones in the earth for them, and he
put the head of each one of them on its stone and he likewise
put Ferchu Longsech's head on its stone. Hence

the Dommandach, to fight with Cuchulain. Own brothers
were he and Daman, Ferdiad's father. A man, rough,
inordinate in eating and sleeping was this Mann. An
ill-tongued foul-mouthed man like Dubthach Doel ('Black-tongue')
of Ulster. A man, stout, mighty, with strength
of limb like Munremur ('Thick-neck') son of Gerrcend
('Short-head'). A fiery champion like Triscoth, the strong
man of Conchobar's household. &quot;I will go,&quot; said he,
&quot;and unarmed, and I will grind him between my hands,
for I consider it no honour nor credit to use arms against a
beardless madcap such as he.&quot;</p>

<p>Therewith he went to attack Cuchulain. There he
was, himself and his charioteer on the ford watching
the host. &quot;A lone warrior approacheth us here,&quot; cried
Laeg to Cuchulain. &quot;What manner of man?&quot; asked
Cuchulain. &quot;A dark, black man, strong, bull-like, and
he unarmed.&quot; &quot;Let him go by thee,&quot; said Cuchulain.
At that he comes nigh them. &quot;To fight with thee
am I come,&quot; Mann announced. Therewith they fell
to wrestling for a long time, and thrice Mann threw
Cuchulain, till the charioteer incited Cuchulain. &quot;Were
it the champion's portion thou wast contending for in
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_212" name="Page_212" title="212">212</a>
Emain,&quot; spake Laeg, &quot;thou wouldst be all powerful over
the young bloods in Emain!&quot; At these words the hero's
wrath and warrior's rage returned to Cuchulain, so that
he overcame Mann at the pillar-stone and he fell to pieces
in morsels. Hence cometh Mag Mandachta ('the Plain of
Mann's death').<a name="footnotetag2_211" id="footnotetag2_211" href="#footnote2_211"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<h2><span class="sc">XIXc</span>. <a name="footnotetag1_213" id="footnotetag1_213" href="#footnote1_213"><sup>1</sup></a>THE COMBAT OF CALATIN'S CHILDREN<a href="#footnote1_213"><sup>1</sup></a></h2>


<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 2918.</span>
Then was it debated by the men of Erin who would be fit
to contend and cope with Cuchulain at the morning hour
early on the next day. What they all said was, that Calatin
Dana ('the Bold') would be the one, with his seven and
twenty sons and his grandson<a name="footnotetaga_213" id="footnotetaga_213" href="#footnotea_213"><sup>a</sup></a> Glass macDelga. Thus
were they: Poison was on every man of them and poison
on every weapon of their arms; and not one of them missed
his throw, and there was no one on whom one of them
drew blood that, if he succumbed not on the spot, would
not be dead before the end of the ninth day. Great gifts
were promised to them for engaging to do battle and to
contend <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 80b.</span> <a name="footnotetag2_213" id="footnotetag2_213" href="#footnote2_213"><sup>2</sup></a>with Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote2_213"><sup>2</sup></a> And they took the matter
in hand, and it should be in the presence of Fergus that
the covenant would be made. But Fergus refused to have
part therein, for what they <a name="footnotetag3_213" id="footnotetag3_213" href="#footnote3_213"><sup>3</sup></a>all<a href="#footnote3_213"><sup>3</sup></a> contended was that they
would hold it as a single combat, <a name="footnotetag4_213" id="footnotetag4_213" href="#footnote4_213"><sup>4</sup></a>a combat, to wit, of<a href="#footnote4_213"><sup>4</sup></a>
Calatin Dana and his seven and twenty sons and his grandson
Glass macDelga; for their contention was that his
son was a limb of his limbs and a part of his parts, and
that to Calatin Dana belonged all that proceeded from his
body.</p>

<p>Fergus betook himself to his tent and to his people and
he breathed his sigh of weariness aloud. &quot;Grievous it
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_214" name="Page_214" title="214">214</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2935.</span>
seems to us, the deed to be done here on the morrow,&quot;
quoth Fergus. &quot;What deed may that be?&quot; asked his
people. &quot;The slaying of Cuchulain,&quot; answered Fergus.
&quot;Alas,&quot; said they, &quot;who should kill him?&quot; &quot;Calatin
Dana,&quot; he replied, &quot;with his seven and twenty sons and
his grandson Glass macDelga. For this is their nature:
Poison is on every man of them and poison on every weapon
of their arms; and there is no one on whom one of them
draws blood, that, if he succumb not on the spot, will not
be dead before the end of the ninth day. And there is no
one <a name="footnotetag1_214" id="footnotetag1_214" href="#footnote1_214"><sup>1</sup></a>of you<a href="#footnote1_214"><sup>1</sup></a> that would go and learn for me and be witness
of the battle and fight and bring me news how Cuchulain
died on whom I would not bestow my blessing and
armour.&quot; &quot;I will go thither,&quot; spake Fiachu son of Ferfeb&egrave;.</p>

<p>They abode so that night. Early on the morrow Calatin
Dana arose with his seven and twenty sons and his
grandson Glass macDelga, and they went forward to where
Cuchulain was. And there went also Fiachu son of Ferfeb&egrave;.
And when Calatin arrived at the place where Cuchulain
was, they forthwith hurled their nine and twenty spears,
and not one of them went past him by a misthrow. Cuchulain
played the edge-feat with his shield, so that all the
spears sank up to their middles into the shield. But for
all that theirs was no erring cast, not one of the spears
was blooded or reddened upon him. Thereupon Cuchulain
drew <a name="footnotetag2_214" id="footnotetag2_214" href="#footnote2_214"><sup>2</sup></a>his<a href="#footnote2_214"><sup>2</sup></a> sword from the sheath of the Badb, to cut away
the weapons and lighten the shield that was on him. While
thus engaged, they rushed in upon him and delivered their
nine and twenty right fists at the same time on his head.
They smote him and curbed him withal, till his face and
his countenance and visage met the sand and gravel of the
ford. Cuchulain raised his warrior's shout aloud and his
cry of unequal combat, so that there was not an Ulsterman
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_215" name="Page_215" title="215">215</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2962.</span>
alive <a name="footnotetag1_215" id="footnotetag1_215" href="#footnote1_215"><sup>1</sup></a>in the camp<a href="#footnote1_215"><sup>1</sup></a> of those that were not asleep but heard
it. Then <a name="footnotetag2_215" id="footnotetag2_215" href="#footnote2_215"><sup>2</sup></a>when they all had reached for their swords,<a href="#footnote2_215"><sup>2</sup></a>
came Fiachu son of Ferfeb&egrave; <a name="footnotetag3_215" id="footnotetag3_215" href="#footnote3_215"><sup>3</sup></a>after them out of the camp,<a href="#footnote3_215"><sup>3</sup></a>
and he saw what they did and a qualm of <a name="footnotetag4_215" id="footnotetag4_215" href="#footnote4_215"><sup>4</sup></a>love and<a href="#footnote4_215"><sup>4</sup></a>
the bond of kindred came over him, and <a name="footnotetag5_215" id="footnotetag5_215" href="#footnote5_215"><sup>5</sup></a>when he saw
all their hands raised against Cuchulain, he leaped from
his chariot and<a href="#footnote5_215"><sup>5</sup></a> drew his sword from the sheath of the
Badb and dealt them a blow, so that he cut off their nine
and twenty right fists from them at one stroke, and they
all fell backwards from the intensity of the exertion and
hold which they had.</p>

<p>Cuchulain raised his head and drew breath and gave a
sigh of weariness and perceived who it was that had
come to his aid. &quot;A ready relief, O foster-brother, <a name="footnotetag6_215" id="footnotetag6_215" href="#footnote6_215"><sup>6</sup></a>what
thou hast done,&quot;<a href="#footnote6_215"><sup>6</sup></a> said Cuchulain. &quot;Although for thee
a ready relief,&quot; said Fiachu, &quot;yet is it not so for us.
Even though we are the best division of three thousand
of the Clann Rudraige in the camp and station of the men
of Erin, <a name="footnotetag7_215" id="footnotetag7_215" href="#footnote7_215"><sup>7</sup></a>nevertheless this small thing is a breach of covenant
in us men of Ulster. If one of Calatin's children
reaches the camp,<a href="#footnote7_215"><sup>7</sup></a> we shall all be brought under the mouth
of spear and of sword, however feeble thou mayst deem
the blow I struck, if this treason be found in us.&quot; &quot;I give
my word,&quot; quoth Cuchulain; &quot;so soon as I raise my head
and draw breath, <a name="footnotetag8_215" id="footnotetag8_215" href="#footnote8_215"><sup>8</sup></a>not a man of them shall reach the camp
alive,<a href="#footnote8_215"><sup>8</sup></a> and unless thou thyself tellest the tale not one of
these ever will tell it!&quot;</p>

<p>With that, Cuchulain turned on them, and he fell to
smiting and hewing them, so that he sent them <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 81a.</span> from him
in small disjointed pieces and divided quarters eastwards
and westwards along the ford. A single man got away
from him, trusting to his speed while Cuchulain was busied
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_216" name="Page_216" title="216">216</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 2981.</span>
beheading the rest; it was Glass macDelga. And Cuchulain
raced after him like a blast of wind, and Glass ran
on round the tent of Ailill and Medb, and all he could
pant out was, &quot;Fiach! Fiach!&quot;<a name="footnotetaga_216" id="footnotetaga_216" href="#footnotea_216"><sup>a</sup></a> when Cuchulain fetched
him a stroke that cut off his head.</p>

<p>&quot;'Tis quick work was made of that man,&quot; quoth Medb.
&quot;What debt was that he spoke of, O Fergus?&quot; &quot;I know
not,&quot; Fergus answered, &quot;unless it be some one in the camp
and quarters that owed him a debt. It is that which
troubled his mind. But be that as it may,&quot; continued
Fergus, &quot;it is a debt of blood and flesh for him. And upon
my word,&quot; Fergus added, &quot;now are his debts paid to him for
good and all!&quot;</p>

<p>In this wise fell Calatin Dana ('the Bold') at the hands
of Cuchulain, together with his seven and twenty sons and
his grandson Glass macDelga <a name="footnotetag1_216" id="footnotetag1_216" href="#footnote1_216"><sup>1</sup></a>and the two sons of Ficc&egrave;
with them, two bold warriors of Ulster who had come to
use their strength on the host.<a href="#footnote1_216"><sup>1</sup></a> So that for evermore in
the bed of the ford is still the rock whereabout they had
their strife and struggle <a name="footnotetag2_216" id="footnotetag2_216" href="#footnote2_216"><sup>2</sup></a>and their slaughtering of each
other;<a href="#footnote2_216"><sup>2</sup></a> and the mark of their sword-hilts is in it and of
their knees and their elbows <a name="footnotetag3_216" id="footnotetag3_216" href="#footnote3_216"><sup>3</sup></a>and their fists<a href="#footnote3_216"><sup>3</sup></a> and the butt-ends
of their spears. <a name="footnotetag4_216" id="footnotetag4_216" href="#footnote4_216"><sup>4</sup></a>And their nine and twenty standing
stones were set up there.<a href="#footnote4_216"><sup>4</sup></a> Hence Fuil Iairn ('Blood of
Iron') to the west<a name="footnotetagb_216" id="footnotetagb_216" href="#footnoteb_216"><sup>b</sup></a> of Ath Firdead ('Ferdiad's Ford') is
the name of the ford. It is for this it is called Fuil Iairn,
because of the 'blood over weapons'<a name="footnotetagc_216" id="footnotetagc_216" href="#footnotec_216"><sup>c</sup></a> that was there.</p>

<p>Thus far then <a name="footnotetag5_216" id="footnotetag5_216" href="#footnote5_216"><sup>5</sup></a>this exploit on the T&aacute;in,<a href="#footnote5_216"><sup>5</sup></a> the Combat

<p><a name="footnotetag2_217" id="footnotetag2_217" href="#footnote2_217"><sup>2</sup></a>The four grand provinces of Erin were side by side and
against Cuchulain, from Monday before Samain-tide<a name="footnotetaga_217" id="footnotetaga_217" href="#footnotea_217"><sup>a</sup></a> to
Wednesday after Spring-beginning, and without leave to
work harm or vent their rage on the province of Ulster,
while yet all the Ulstermen were sunk in their nine days'
'Pains,' and Conall Cernach ('the Victorious') sought out
battle in strange foreign lands paying the tribute and tax
of Ulster. Great was the plight and strait of Cuchulain
during that time, for he was not a day or a night without
fierce, fiery combat waged on him by the men of Erin, until
he killed Calatin with his seven and twenty sons and Fraech
son of Fiadach and performed many deeds and successes
which are not enumerated here. Now this was sore and
grievous for Medb and for Ailill.<a href="#footnote2_217"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 3001.</span>
Then the men of Erin took counsel who would be fit <a name="footnotetag3_217" id="footnotetag3_217" href="#footnote3_217"><sup>3</sup></a>to
send to the ford<a href="#footnote3_217"><sup>3</sup></a> to fight and do battle with Cuchulain,
<a name="footnotetag4_217" id="footnotetag4_217" href="#footnote4_217"><sup>4</sup></a>to drive him off from them<a href="#footnote4_217"><sup>4</sup></a> at the morning hour early
on the morrow.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag5_217" id="footnotetag5_217" href="#footnote5_217"><sup>5</sup></a>With one accord<a href="#footnote5_217"><sup>5</sup></a> they declared that it should be
Ferdiad son of Daman son of Dar&egrave;, the great and valiant
warrior of the men of Domnann, <a name="footnotetag6_217" id="footnotetag6_217" href="#footnote6_217"><sup>6</sup></a>the horn-skin from Irrus
Domnann, the irresistible force, and the battle-rock of
destruction, the own, dear, foster-brother of Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote6_217"><sup>6</sup></a>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_218" name="Page_218" title="218">218</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3005.</span>
<a name="footnotetag1_218" id="footnotetag1_218" href="#footnote1_218"><sup>1</sup></a>And fitting it was for him to go thither,<a href="#footnote1_218"><sup>1</sup></a> for well-matched
and alike was their manner of fight and of combat. Under
the same instructresses had they done skilful deeds of valour
and arms, when learning the art with Scathach ('the
Modest') and with Uathach ('the Dreadful') and with Aif&egrave;
('the Handsome'). <a name="footnotetag2_218" id="footnotetag2_218" href="#footnote2_218"><sup>2</sup></a>Yet was it the felling of an oak with
one's fists, and the stretching of the hand into a serpent's
nest, and a spring into the lair of a lion, for hero or champion
in the world, aside from Cuchulain, to fight or combat with
Ferdiad on whatever ford or river or mere he set his shield.<a href="#footnote2_218"><sup>2</sup></a>
And neither of them overmatched the other, save in the
feat of the Gae Bulga ('the Barbed Spear') which Cuchulain
possessed. Howbeit, against this, Ferdiad was horn-skinned
when fighting and in combat with a warrior on the
ford; <a name="footnotetag3_218" id="footnotetag3_218" href="#footnote3_218"><sup>3</sup></a>and they thought he could avoid the Gae Bulga
and defend himself against it, because of the horn about
him of such kind that neither arms nor multitude of edges
could pierce it.<a href="#footnote3_218"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Then were messengers and envoys sent <a name="footnotetag4_218" id="footnotetag4_218" href="#footnote4_218"><sup>4</sup></a>from Medb and
Ailill<a href="#footnote4_218"><sup>4</sup></a> to Ferdiad. Ferdiad denied them their will, and
dismissed and sent back the messengers, and he went not
with them, for he knew wherefore they would have him, to
fight and combat with his friend, with his comrade and
foster-brother, <a name="footnotetag5_218" id="footnotetag5_218" href="#footnote5_218"><sup>5</sup></a>Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote5_218"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Then did Medb despatch the druids <a name="footnotetag6_218" id="footnotetag6_218" href="#footnote6_218"><sup>6</sup></a>and the poets of the
camp,<a href="#footnote6_218"><sup>6</sup></a> the lampoonists and hard-attackers,<a name="footnotetaga_218" id="footnotetaga_218" href="#footnotea_218"><sup>a</sup></a> for Ferdiad, to
the end that they might make three satires to stay him
and three scoffing speeches against him, <a name="footnotetag7_218" id="footnotetag7_218" href="#footnote7_218"><sup>7</sup></a>to mock at him
and revile and disgrace him,<a href="#footnote7_218"><sup>7</sup></a> that they might raise three
blisters on his face, Blame, Blemish and Disgrace, <a name="footnotetag8_218" id="footnotetag8_218" href="#footnote8_218"><sup>8</sup></a>that
he might not find a place in the world to lay his head,<a href="#footnote8_218"><sup>8</sup></a>

<p>Ferdiad came with them for the sake of his own honour

as he deemed it better to fall by the shafts of valour and
bravery and skill, than to fall by the shafts of satire, abuse
and reproach. And when <a name="footnotetag4_219" id="footnotetag4_219" href="#footnote4_219"><sup>4</sup></a>Ferdiad<a href="#footnote4_219"><sup>4</sup></a> was come <a name="footnotetag5_219" id="footnotetag5_219" href="#footnote5_219"><sup>5</sup></a>into the

their trusty people were, and <a href="#footnote6_219"><sup>6</sup></a>he was honoured and waited
on, and choice, well-flavoured strong liquor was poured
out for him till he became drunken and merry. <a name="footnotetag7_219" id="footnotetag7_219" href="#footnote7_219"><sup>7</sup></a>Finnabair,
daughter of Ailill and Medb, was seated at his side.
It was Finnabair that placed her hand on every goblet and
cup Ferdiad quaffed. She it was that gave him three
kisses with every cup that he took. She it was that passed
him sweet-smelling apples over the bosom of her tunic.
This is what she ceased not to say, that her darling and
her chosen sweetheart of the world's men was Ferdiad.<a href="#footnote7_219"><sup>7</sup></a>
<a name="footnotetag8_219" id="footnotetag8_219" href="#footnote8_219"><sup>8</sup></a>And when Medb got Ferdiad drunken and merry,<a href="#footnote8_219"><sup>8</sup></a> great

Medb, &quot;he would not think it too much if thou shouldst
fall by his hands in the choicest feat of his skill in arms, in
the land whereto he should come.&quot; &quot;It was not just for
him to speak so,&quot; quoth Ferdiad; &quot;for it is not cowardice

by night.<a href="#footnote5_224"><sup>5</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag6_224" id="footnotetag6_224" href="#footnote6_224"><sup>6</sup></a>And I speak not so to him, for I have it not

<p><a name="footnotetag9_224" id="footnotetag9_224" href="#footnote9_224"><sup>9</sup></a>And he gave his word in the presence of them all that
he would go and meet Cuchulain. For it pleased Medb,
if Ferdiad should fail to go, to have them as a witness against
him, in order that she might say it was fear or dread that
caused him to break his word.<a href="#footnote9_224"><sup>9</sup></a> &quot;A blessing <a name="footnotetag10_224" id="footnotetag10_224" href="#footnote10_224"><sup>10</sup></a>and victory<a href="#footnote10_224"><sup>10</sup></a>
upon thee for that!&quot; said Medb; &quot;it pleaseth me more
than for thee to show fear and lack of boldness. For every
man loves his own land, and how is it better for him to
seek the welfare of Ulster, <a name="footnotetag11_224" id="footnotetag11_224" href="#footnote11_224"><sup>11</sup></a>because his mother was descended
from the Ulstermen,<a href="#footnote11_224"><sup>11</sup></a> than for thee to seek the

Connacht?&quot;<a href="#footnote12_224"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>Then it was that Medb obtained from Ferdiad the easy
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_225" name="Page_225" title="225">225</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3163.</span>
surety of a covenant to fight and contend on the morrow

and contend with Cuchulain alone, if to him this last seemed
lighter. Ferdiad obtained <a name="footnotetag2_225" id="footnotetag2_225" href="#footnote2_225"><sup>2</sup></a>of Medb<a href="#footnote2_225"><sup>2</sup></a> the easy surety, <a name="footnotetag3_225" id="footnotetag3_225" href="#footnote3_225"><sup>3</sup></a>as
he thought,<a href="#footnote3_225"><sup>3</sup></a> to send the aforesaid six men for the fulfilment
of the terms which had been promised him, should Cuchulain
fall at his hands.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag4_225" id="footnotetag4_225" href="#footnote4_225"><sup>4</sup></a>There was a wonderful warrior of the Ulstermen present
at that covenant, and that was Fergus macRoig. Fergus
betook him to his tent. &quot;Woe is me, for the deed that
will be done on the morning of the morrow!&quot; &quot;What
deed is that?&quot; his tent-folk asked. &quot;My good fosterling
Cuchulain will be slain!&quot; &quot;Good lack! who makes that
boast?&quot; &quot;Not hard to say: None other but his dear,
devoted foster-brother, Ferdiad son of Daman. Why
bear ye not my blessing,&quot; Fergus continued, &quot;and let one
of you go with a warning and mercy to Cuchulain, if perchance
he would leave the ford on the morn of the morrow?&quot;
&quot;As we live,&quot; said they; &quot;though it were thyself was on
the ford of battle, we would not go near him to seek thee.&quot;
&quot;Come, my lad,&quot; cried Fergus, &quot;get our horses for us,
and yoke the chariot!&quot;<a href="#footnote4_225"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Then were Fergus' horses fetched for him and his chariot
was yoked, and he came forward to the place <a name="footnotetag5_225" id="footnotetag5_225" href="#footnote5_225"><sup>5</sup></a>of combat<a href="#footnote5_225"><sup>5</sup></a>
where Cuchulain was, to inform him <a name="footnotetag6_225" id="footnotetag6_225" href="#footnote6_225"><sup>6</sup></a>of the challenge, that
Ferdiad was to fight with him.<a href="#footnote6_225"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag7_225" id="footnotetag7_225" href="#footnote7_225"><sup>7</sup></a>&quot;A chariot cometh hither towards us, O Cuchulain!&quot;
cried Laeg. For in this wise was the gilla, with his back towards
his lord. He used to win every other game of draughts
and of chess from his master. Watch and guard of the four
airts was he besides. &quot;What manner of chariot is it?&quot;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_226" name="Page_226" title="226">226</a>
asked Cuchulain. &quot;A chariot like to a royal fort, huge,
with its yoke, strong, golden; with its great board of copper;
with its shafts of bronze; with its thin-framed, dry-bodied
box (?) ... set on two horses, black, swift, stout,
strong-forked, thick-set, under beautiful shafts. One kingly,
broad-eyed warrior is the combatant in the chariot. A
curly, forked beard he wears that reaches below outside
over the smooth lower part of his soft tunic, which would
shelter fifty warriors on a day of storm and rain under the
heavy shield of the warrior's beard. A bent buckler,
white, beautiful, of many colours, he bears, with three
stout-wrought chains, so that there is room from edge to
edge for four troops of ten men behind the leather of the
shield which hangs upon the broad back of the warrior.
A long, hard-edged, broad, red sword in a sheath woven
and twisted of white silver, over the ... of the battle-warrior.
A strong, three-ridged spear, wound and banded
with all-gleaming white silver he has lying across the
chariot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not difficult to recognize him,&quot; said Cuchulain: &quot;'tis
my master Fergus that cometh hither with a warning and
with compassion for me, before all the four provinces of
Erin.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 3172.</span>
Fergus drew nigh and sprang from his chariot.<a href="#footnote7_226"><sup>7</sup></a> Cuchulain
bade him welcome. <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 82a.</span> &quot;Welcome is thy coming, O

birds comes into the plain, thou shalt have a duck with

and a drink of cold water from the sand thou shalt have

Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote1_226"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;Truly intended, methinks, the welcome, O

with thee at the morning hour early on the morrow.&quot;
&quot;E'en so will we hear it from thee,&quot; said Cuchulain. &quot;Thine

will be thus&quot; (said the charioteer) &quot;Ferdiad will come to
attack thee, with new beauty of plaiting and dressing of
hair, and washing and bathing, and the four provinces of
Erin with him to look at the combat. I would that thou
wouldst go where thou wilt get a like adorning for thyself,

Then Cuchulain went thither that night <a name="footnotetag3_230" id="footnotetag3_230" href="#footnote3_230"><sup>3</sup></a>to Dundelgan,<a href="#footnote3_230"><sup>3</sup></a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 3235.</span>
<a name="footnotetag5_230" id="footnotetag5_230" href="#footnote5_230"><sup>5</sup></a>As for<a href="#footnote5_230"><sup>5</sup></a> Ferdiad, he betook himself to his tent and to
his people, and imparted to them the easy surety which
Medb had obtained from him to do combat and battle
with six warriors on the morrow, or to do combat and
battle with Cuchulain alone, if he thought it a lighter task.
He made known to them also the fair terms he had obtained
from Medb of sending the same six warriors for the fulfilment
of the covenant she had made with him, should Cuchulain
fall by his hands.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag6_230" id="footnotetag6_230" href="#footnote6_230"><sup>6</sup></a>The folk of Ferdiad were not joyful, blithe, cheerful
or merry that night,<a href="#footnote6_230"><sup>6</sup></a> <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 82b.</span> but they were sad, sorrowful
and downcast, for they knew that where the two champions
and the two bulwarks in a gap for a hundred, <a name="footnotetag7_230" id="footnotetag7_230" href="#footnote7_230"><sup>7</sup></a>the two
pillars of battle and strife of the men of Erin<a href="#footnote7_230"><sup>7</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag8_230" id="footnotetag8_230" href="#footnote8_230"><sup>8</sup></a>of that
time<a href="#footnote8_230"><sup>8</sup></a> met in combat, one or other of them would fall there
or both would fall, and if it should be one of them, they
believed it would be <a name="footnotetag9_230" id="footnotetag9_230" href="#footnote9_230"><sup>9</sup></a>their king and<a href="#footnote9_230"><sup>9</sup></a> their own lord <a name="footnotetag10_230" id="footnotetag10_230" href="#footnote10_230"><sup>10</sup></a>that
would fall there,<a href="#footnote10_230"><sup>10</sup></a> for it was not easy to contend and do
battle with Cuchulain on the Raid for the Kine of Cualnge.</p>

<p>Ferdiad slept right heavily the first part of the night,
but when the end of the night was come, his sleep and his
heaviness left him. And the anxiousness of the combat
and the battle came upon him. <a name="footnotetag11_230" id="footnotetag11_230" href="#footnote11_230"><sup>11</sup></a>But most troubled in
spirit was he that he should allow all the treasures to pass
from him, and the maiden, by reason of combat with one
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_231" name="Page_231" title="231">231</a>
man. Unless he fought with that one man, he must needs
fight with six champions on the morrow. What tormented
him more than that was, should he once show himself on
the ford to Cuchulain he was certain he would never have
power of head or of life ever after. And Ferdiad arose
early on the morrow.<a name="footnotetag11_231" id="footnotetag11_231" href="#footnote11_230"><sup>11</sup></a> <span class="sidenoteL">W. 3252.</span> And he charged his charioteer to
take his horses and to yoke his chariot. The charioteer
sought to dissuade him <a name="footnotetag1_231" id="footnotetag1_231" href="#footnote1_231"><sup>1</sup></a>from that journey.<a href="#footnote1_231"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_231" id="footnotetag2_231" href="#footnote2_231"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;By our
word,&quot;<a href="#footnote2_231"><sup>2</sup></a> said the gilla, &quot;'twould be better for thee<a name="footnotetaga_231" id="footnotetaga_231" href="#footnotea_231"><sup>a</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_231" id="footnotetag3_231" href="#footnote3_231"><sup>3</sup></a>to

commend it for thee than I condemn it.&quot;<a href="#footnote3_231"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;Hold thy
peace about us, boy!&quot; quoth Ferdiad, <a name="footnotetag4_231" id="footnotetag4_231" href="#footnote4_231"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;for we will brook
no interference from any one concerning this journey.<a href="#footnote4_231"><sup>4</sup></a>
<a name="footnotetag5_231" id="footnotetag5_231" href="#footnote5_231"><sup>5</sup></a>For the promise we gave to Medb and Ailill in the presence
of the men of Erin, it would shame us to break it; for they
would say it was fear or dread that caused us to break it.
And, by my conscience, I would almost liefer fall myself
by Cuchulain's hand than that he should fall by mine on
this occasion. And should Cuchulain fall by my hand on
the ford of combat, then shall Medb and many of the men
of Erin fall by my hand because of the pledge they extorted
from me, and I drunken and merry.<a href="#footnote5_231"><sup>5</sup></a> And in this manner
he spake, <a name="footnotetag6_231" id="footnotetag6_231" href="#footnote6_231"><sup>6</sup></a>conversing with the charioteer,<a href="#footnote6_231"><sup>6</sup></a> and he uttered

<p>Ferdiad's horses were now brought forth and his chariot
was hitched, and he set out <a name="footnotetag2_232" id="footnotetag2_232" href="#footnote2_232"><sup>2</sup></a>from the camp<a href="#footnote2_232"><sup>2</sup></a> for the ford
of battle when yet day with its full light had not come there
for him. <a name="footnotetag3_232" id="footnotetag3_232" href="#footnote3_232"><sup>3</sup></a>&quot;My lad,&quot; spake Ferdiad, &quot;it is not fitting
that we make our journey without bidding farewell to the
men of Erin. Turn the horses and the chariot for us towards
the men of Erin.&quot; Thrice the servant turned the
heads of the horses and the chariot towards the men of
Erin. Then he came upon Medb letting her water from
her on the floor of the tent. &quot;Ailill, sleepest thou still?&quot;
asked Medb. &quot;Not so!&quot; replied Ailill. &quot;Dost hear thy
new son-in-law taking farewell, of thee?&quot; &quot;Is that what
he doth?&quot; asked Ailill. &quot;'Tis that, verily,&quot; Medb made
answer; &quot;but I swear by what my tribe swears, not on
the same feet will the man who makes that greeting come
back to you.&quot; &quot;Howbeit, we have profited by a happy
alliance of marriage with him,&quot; quoth Ailill; &quot;if only
Cuchulain falls by his hand, I should be pleased if they
both fell, yet would I prefer that Ferdiad should escape.&quot;</p>

<p>Ferdiad came to the ford of combat. &quot;Look, my lad!&quot;
said Ferdiad, &quot;is Cuchulain on the ford?&quot; &quot;That he
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_233" name="Page_233" title="233">233</a>
is not,&quot; replied the gilla. &quot;Look well for us,&quot; said Ferdiad.
&quot;Cuchulain is not a little speck where he would be
in hiding,&quot; answered the gilla. &quot;'Tis true, then, my lad;
till this day Cuchulain hath not heard of a goodly warrior
coming to meet him on the Cow-spoil of Cualnge, and now
when he has heard of one, he has left the ford.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shame for thee to slander Cuchulain in his absence.
Rememberest thou not when ye gave battle to German
Garbglas above the borders of the Tyrrhene Sea, thou leftest
thy sword with the hosts, and it was Cuchulain who slew a
hundred warriors till he reached it and brought it to thee?
And mindest thou well where we were that night?&quot; the
gilla asked further. &quot;I know not,&quot; Ferdiad answered.
&quot;At the house of Scathach's steward,&quot; said the other;
&quot;and thou wentest ... and proudly in advance of us
all into the house. The churl gave thee a blow with his
three-pointed fork in the small of the back, so that thou
flewest like a bolt out over the door. Cuchulain came in
and gave the churl a blow with his sword, so that he made
two pieces of him. I was their house-steward whilst ye were
in that place. If it were that day, thou wouldst not say
thou wast a better warrior than Cuchulain.&quot; &quot;Wrong is
what thou hast done, O gilla,&quot; said Ferdiad; &quot;for I would
not have come to the combat, hadst thou spoken thus to
me at first. Why dost thou not lay the chariot-poles at my
side and the skin-coverings under my head, that so I may
sleep now?&quot; &quot;Alas,&quot; said the gilla, &quot;'tis a sorry sleep
before deer and packs of wolves here!&quot; &quot;How so, gilla?
Art thou not able to keep watch and guard for me?&quot; &quot;I
am,&quot; the gilla answered; &quot;unless they come in clouds or
in the air to attack thee, they shall not come from east or
from west to attack thee without warning, without notice.&quot;<a name="footnotetag3_233" id="footnotetag3_233" href="#footnote3_232"><sup>3</sup></a>
&quot;Come, gilla,&quot; said Ferdiad, <a name="footnotetag1_233" id="footnotetag1_233" href="#footnote1_233"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;unharness the horses and<a href="#footnote1_233"><sup>1</sup></a>

spread for me the cushions and skins of my chariot under
me here, so that I sleep off my heavy fit of sleep and slumber
here, for I slept not the last part of the night with the
anxiousness of the battle and combat.&quot;</p>

<p>The gilla unharnessed the horses; he unfastened the
chariot under him, <a name="footnotetag1_234" id="footnotetag1_234" href="#footnote1_234"><sup>1</sup></a>and spread beneath him the chariot-cloths.<a href="#footnote1_234"><sup>1</sup></a>

him. <a name="footnotetag2_234" id="footnotetag2_234" href="#footnote2_234"><sup>2</sup></a>The gilla remained on watch and guard for him.<a href="#footnote2_234"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Now how Cuchulain fared <a name="footnotetag3_234" id="footnotetag3_234" href="#footnote3_234"><sup>3</sup></a>is related<a href="#footnote3_234"><sup>3</sup></a> here: He arose
not till the day with its bright light had come to him, lest
the men of Erin might say it was fear or fright of the champion
he had, if he should arise <a name="footnotetag4_234" id="footnotetag4_234" href="#footnote4_234"><sup>4</sup></a>early.<a href="#footnote4_234"><sup>4</sup></a> And when day
with its full light had come, he <a name="footnotetag5_234" id="footnotetag5_234" href="#footnote5_234"><sup>5</sup></a>passed his hand over his
face and<a href="#footnote5_234"><sup>5</sup></a> bade his charioteer take his horses and yoke
them to his chariot. &quot;Come, gilla,&quot; said Cuchulain, &quot;take
out our horses for us and harness our chariot, for an early
riser is the warrior appointed to meet us, Ferdiad son of
Daman son of Dar&egrave;. <a name="footnotetag6_234" id="footnotetag6_234" href="#footnote6_234"><sup>6</sup></a>If Ferdiad awaits us, he must needs

stepped into the chariot and they pressed forward to the
ford.<a href="#footnote9_234"><sup>9</sup></a> Then it was that the cutting, feat-performing,
battle-winning, red-sworded hero, Cuchulain son of Sualtaim,
mounted his chariot, so that there shrieked around him
the goblins and fiends and the sprites of the glens and the
demons of the air; for the Tuatha De Danann ('the Folk
of the Goddess Danu') were wont to set up their cries around
him, to the end that the dread and the fear and the fright
and the terror of him might be so much the greater in every

battle and on every field, in every fight and in every combat
wherein he went.</p>

<p>Not long had Ferdiad's charioteer waited when he heard
something: <a name="footnotetag1_235" id="footnotetag1_235" href="#footnote1_235"><sup>1</sup></a>A rush and a crash and a hurtling sound,
and a din and a thunder,<a href="#footnote1_235"><sup>1</sup></a> <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 83a.</span> and a clatter and a clash, namely,
the shield-cry of feat-shields, and the jangle of javelins, and
the deed-striking of swords, and the thud of the helmet,
<a name="footnotetag2_235" id="footnotetag2_235" href="#footnote2_235"><sup>2</sup></a>and the ring of spears,<a href="#footnote2_235"><sup>2</sup></a> and the clang of the cuirass, and
the striking of arms, the fury of feats, the straining of ropes,
and the whirr of wheels, and the creaking of the chariot,
and the trampling of horses' hoofs, and the deep voice of
the hero and battle-warrior <a name="footnotetag3_235" id="footnotetag3_235" href="#footnote3_235"><sup>3</sup></a>in grave speech with his
servant<a href="#footnote3_235"><sup>3</sup></a> on his way to the ford to attack his opponent.</p>

broad-hoofed, slender-limbed, overpowering and resolute.
A grey, broad-hipped, small-stepping, long-maned horse,
<a name="footnotetag10_237" id="footnotetag10_237" href="#footnote10_237"><sup>10</sup></a>whose name was Liath ('the Roan') of Macha,<a href="#footnote10_237"><sup>10</sup></a> was under
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_238" name="Page_238" title="238">238</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3379.</span>
one of the yokes of the chariot; a black, crisp&egrave;d-maned,
swift-moving, broad-backed horse, <a name="footnotetag1_238" id="footnotetag1_238" href="#footnote1_238"><sup>1</sup></a>whose name was Dubh
('the Black') of Sithleann,<a href="#footnote1_238"><sup>1</sup></a> under the other. Like unto a
hawk after its prey on a sharp tempestuous day, or to a
tearing blast of wind of Spring on a March day over the
back of a plain, or unto a startled stag when first roused
by the hounds in the first of the chase, <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 83b.</span> were Cuchulain's
two horses before the chariot, as if they were on glowing,
fiery flags, so that they shook the earth and made it tremble
with the fleetness of their course.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag2_238" id="footnotetag2_238" href="#footnote2_238"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;In the front of this chariot is a man with fair, curly,
long hair. There is around him a cloak, blue, Parthian
purple. A spear with red and keen-cutting blades, flaming-red
in his hand. The semblance of three heads of hair he
has, namely, brown hair next to the skin of his head, blood-red
hair in the middle, a crown of gold is the third head
of hair.</p>

<p>&quot;Beautiful is the arrangement of that hair so that it
makes three coils down behind over his shoulders. Even as
a thread of gold it seems, when its hue has been wrought
over the edge of an anvil; or like to the yellow of bees whereon
shines the sun on a summer's day is the shining of each
single hair of his hair. Seven toes he has on each of his
feet and seven fingers on each of his hands and the brilliance
of a very great fire is around his eye.</p>

<p>&quot;Befitting him is the charioteer beside him, with curly,
jet-black hair, shorn broad over his head. A cowled garment
around him, open at the elbows. A horse-whip, very
fine and golden in his hand, and a light-grey cloak wrapped
around him, and a goad of white silver in his hand. He
plies the goad on the horses whatever way would go the
deed-renowned warrior that is in the chariot.&quot;<a href="#footnote2_238"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>And Cuchulain reached the ford. Ferdiad waited on
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_239" name="Page_239" title="239">239</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3387.</span>
the south side of the ford; Cuchulain stood on the north
side. Ferdiad bade welcome to Cuchulain. &quot;Welcome is thy
coming, O Cuchulain!&quot; said Ferdiad. &quot;Truly spoken
meseemed thy welcome till now,&quot; answered Cuchulain;
&quot;but to-day I put no more trust in it. And, O Ferdiad,&quot;
said Cuchulain, &quot;it were fitter for me to bid thee welcome
than that thou should'st welcome me; for it is thou that art
come to the land and province wherein I dwell; and it is not
fitting for thee to come to contend and do battle with me,
but it were fitter for me to go to contend and do battle with
thee. For before thee in flight are my women and my
boys and my youths, my steeds and my troops of horses,
my droves, my flocks and my herds of cattle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good, O Cuchulain,&quot; spake Ferdiad; &quot;what has ever
brought thee out to contend and do battle with me? For
when we were <a name="footnotetag1_239" id="footnotetag1_239" href="#footnote1_239"><sup>1</sup></a>together<a href="#footnote1_239"><sup>1</sup></a> with Scathach and with Uathach

thou wast my serving-man, even for arming my spear and
dressing my bed.&quot; &quot;That was indeed true,&quot; answered
Cuchulain; &quot;because of my youth and my littleness did I
so much for thee, but this is by no means my mood this day.
For there is not a warrior in the world I would not drive
off this day <a name="footnotetag3_239" id="footnotetag3_239" href="#footnote3_239"><sup>3</sup></a>in the field of battle and combat.&quot;<a href="#footnote3_239"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag4_239" id="footnotetag4_239" href="#footnote4_239"><sup>4</sup></a>It was not long before they met in the middle of the
ford.<a href="#footnote4_239"><sup>4</sup></a> And then it was that each of them cast sharp-cutting
reproaches at the other, renouncing his friendship;
and Ferdiad spake these words there, and Cuchulain responded:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>&quot;Too long are we now in this way,&quot; quoth Ferdiad;
&quot;and what arms shall we resort to to-day, O Cuchulain?&quot;
&quot;With thee is thy choice of weapons this day till night time,&quot;
answered Cuchulain, &quot;for thou art he that first didst reach
the ford.&quot; &quot;Rememberest thou at all,&quot; asked Ferdiad,
&quot;the choice deeds of arms we were wont to practise with
Scathach and with Uathach and with Aif&egrave;?&quot; &quot;Indeed,
and I do remember,&quot; answered Cuchulain. &quot;If thou
rememberest, let us begin <a name="footnotetag3_243" id="footnotetag3_243" href="#footnote3_243"><sup>3</sup></a>with them.&quot;<a href="#footnote3_243"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_244" name="Page_244" title="244">244</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 3555.</span>
They betook them to their choicest deeds of arms. They
took upon them two equally-matched shields for feats,
and their eight-edged targes for feats, and their eight small
darts, and their eight straightswords with ornaments of
walrus-tooth and their eight lesser, ivoried spears which
flew from them and to them like bees <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 84b.</span> on a day of fine
weather.</p>

<p>They cast no weapon that struck not. Each of
them was busy casting at the other with those missiles
from morning's early twilight till noon at mid-day, the while
they overcame their various feats with the bosses and
hollows of their feat-shields. However great the excellence
of the throwing on either side, equally great was the excellence
of the defence, so that during all that time neither of
them bled or reddened the other. &quot;Let us cease now from
this bout of arms, O Cuchulain,&quot; said Ferdiad; &quot;for it is
not by such our decision will come.&quot; &quot;Yea, surely, let
us cease, if the time hath come,&quot; answered Cuchulain.
<a name="footnotetag1_244" id="footnotetag1_244" href="#footnote1_244"><sup>1</sup></a>Then<a href="#footnote1_244"><sup>1</sup></a> they ceased. They threw their feat-tackle from
them into the hands of their charioteers.</p>

<p>&quot;To what weapons shall we resort next, O Cuchulain?&quot;
asked Ferdiad. &quot;Thine is the choice of weapons till nightfall,&quot;
replied Cuchulain; &quot;for thou art he that didst first
reach the ford.&quot; &quot;Let us begin, then,&quot; said Ferdiad, &quot;with
our straight-cut, smooth-hardened throwing-spears, with
cords of full-hard flax on them.&quot; &quot;Aye, let us begin then,&quot;
assented Cuchulain. Then they took on them two hard
shields, equally strong. They fell to their straight-cut,
smooth-hardened spears with cords of full-hard flax on
them. Each of them was engaged in casting at the other
with the spears from the middle of noon <a name="footnotetag2_244" id="footnotetag2_244" href="#footnote2_244"><sup>2</sup></a>till yellowness
came over the sun<a href="#footnote2_244"><sup>2</sup></a> at the hour of evening's sundown.
However great the excellence of the defence, equally great
was the excellence of the throwing on either side, so that
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_245" name="Page_245" title="245">245</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3578.</span>
each of them bled and reddened and wounded the other
during that time. <a name="footnotetag1_245" id="footnotetag1_245" href="#footnote1_245"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;Wouldst thou fain make a truce, O
Cucugan?&quot;<a name="footnotetaga_245" id="footnotetaga_245" href="#footnotea_245"><sup>a</sup></a> asked Ferdiad. &quot;It would please me,&quot; replied
Cuchulain; &quot;for whoso begins with arms has the right to
desist.&quot;<a href="#footnote1_245"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;Let us leave off from this now, O Cuchulain,&quot;
said Ferdiad. &quot;Aye, let us leave off, an the time hath
come,&quot; answered Cuchulain. So they ceased. They threw
their arms from them into the hands of their charioteers.</p>

<p>Thereupon each of them went toward the other <a name="footnotetag2_245" id="footnotetag2_245" href="#footnote2_245"><sup>2</sup></a>in the
middle of the ford,<a href="#footnote2_245"><sup>2</sup></a> and each of them put his hand on the
other's neck and gave him three kisses <a name="footnotetag3_245" id="footnotetag3_245" href="#footnote3_245"><sup>3</sup></a>in remembrance
of his fellowship and friendship.<a href="#footnote3_245"><sup>3</sup></a> Their horses were in
one and the same paddock that night, and their charioteers
at one and the same fire; and their charioteers made ready
a litter-bed of fresh rushes for them with pillows for wounded
men on them. Then came healing and curing folk to heal
and to cure them, and they laid healing herbs and grasses
and a curing charm on their cuts and stabs, their gashes
and many wounds. Of every healing herb and grass and
curing charm that <a name="footnotetag4_245" id="footnotetag4_245" href="#footnote4_245"><sup>4</sup></a>was brought from the fairy dwellings
of Erin to Cuchulain and<a href="#footnote4_245"><sup>4</sup></a> was applied to the cuts and stabs,
to the gashes and many wounds of Cuchulain, a like portion
thereof he sent across the ford westward to Ferdiad, <a name="footnotetag5_245" id="footnotetag5_245" href="#footnote5_245"><sup>5</sup></a>to
put to his wounds and his pools of gore,<a href="#footnote5_245"><sup>5</sup></a> so that the men of
Erin should not have it to say, should Ferdiad fall at his
hands, it was more than his share of care had been given
to him.</p>

<p>Of every food and of every savoury, soothing and strong
drink that was brought by the men of Erin to Ferdiad, a
like portion thereof he sent over the ford northwards to
Cuchulain; for the purveyors of Ferdiad were more numerous
than the purveyors of Cuchulain. All the men of Erin
were purveyors to Ferdiad, to the end that he might keep
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_246" name="Page_246" title="246">246</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3598.</span>
Cuchulain off from them. But only the inhabitants of Mag
Breg ('the Plain of Breg') were purveyors to Cuchulain.
They were wont to come daily, that is, every night, to
converse with him.</p>

<p>They bided there that night. Early on the morrow they
arose and went their ways to the ford of combat. &quot;To
what weapons shall we resort on this day, O Ferdiad?&quot;
asked Cuchulain. <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 85a.</span> &quot;Thine is the choosing of weapons
till night time,&quot; Ferdiad made answer, &quot;because it was I
had my choice of weapons on the day aforegone.&quot; &quot;Let
us take, then,&quot; said Cuchulain, &quot;to our great, well-tempered
lances to-day, for we think that the thrusting will bring
nearer the decisive battle to-day than did the casting of
yesterday. Let our horses be brought to us and our chariots
yoked, to the end that we engage in combat over our horses
and chariots on this day.&quot; &quot;Aye, let us go so,&quot; Ferdiad
assented. Thereupon they girded two full-firm broad-shields
on them for that day. They took to their great,
well-tempered lances on that day. Either of them began
to pierce and to drive, to throw and to press down the other,
from early morning's twilight till the hour of evening's
close. If it were the wont for birds in flight to fly through
the bodies of men, they could have passed through their
bodies on that day and carried away pieces of blood and
flesh through their wounds and their sores into the clouds
and the air all around. And when the hour of evening's close
was come, their horses were spent and their drivers were
wearied, and they themselves, the heroes and warriors of
valour, were exhausted. &quot;Let us give over now, O Ferdiad,&quot;
said Cuchulain, &quot;for our horses are spent and our
drivers tired, and when they are exhausted, why should
we too not be exhausted?&quot; And in this wise he spake,
and he uttered these words at that place:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div>&quot;We need not our chariots break&mdash;</div>
<div>This, a struggle fit for giants.</div>
<div>Place the hobbles on the steeds,</div>
<div>Now that din of arms is o'er!&quot;</div>
</div>
</div>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_247" name="Page_247" title="247">247</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 3626.</span>
&quot;Yea, we will cease, if the time hath come,&quot; replied
Ferdiad. They ceased <a name="footnotetag1_247" id="footnotetag1_247" href="#footnote1_247"><sup>1</sup></a>then.<a href="#footnote1_247"><sup>1</sup></a> They threw their arms
away from them into the hands of their charioteers. Each
of them came towards his fellow. Each laid his hand on
the other's neck and gave him three kisses. Their horses
were in the one pen that night, and their charioteers at the
one fire. Their charioteers prepared <a name="footnotetag2_247" id="footnotetag2_247" href="#footnote2_247"><sup>2</sup></a>two<a href="#footnote2_247"><sup>2</sup></a> litter-beds
of fresh rushes for them with pillows for wounded men on
them. The curing and healing men came to attend and
watch and mark them that night; for naught else could
they do, because of the direfulness of their cuts and their
stabs, their gashes and their numerous wounds, but apply
to them philtres and spells and charms, to staunch their
blood and their bleeding and their deadly pains. Of every
magic potion and every spell and every charm that was
applied to the cuts and stabs of Cuchulain, their like share
he sent over the ford westwards to Ferdiad. Of every
food and every savoury, soothing and strong drink that
was brought by the men of Erin to Ferdiad, an equal portion
he sent over the ford northwards to Cuchulain, for the
victuallers of Ferdiad were more numerous than the
victuallers of Cuchulain. For all the men of Erin were
Ferdiad's nourishers, to the end that he might ward off Cuchulain
from them. But the indwellers of the Plain of Breg
alone were Cuchulain's nourishers. They were wont to
come daily, that is, every night, to converse with him.</p>

<p>They abode there that night. Early on the morrow
they arose and repaired to the ford of combat. Cuchulain
marked an evil mien and a dark mood that day <a name="footnotetag3_247" id="footnotetag3_247" href="#footnote3_247"><sup>3</sup></a>beyond
every other day<a href="#footnote3_247"><sup>3</sup></a> on Ferdiad. &quot;It is evil thou appearest
to-day, O Ferdiad,&quot; spake Cuchulain; &quot;thy hair has
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_248" name="Page_248" title="248">248</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3653.</span>
become dark<a name="footnotetaga_248" id="footnotetaga_248" href="#footnotea_248"><sup>a</sup></a> to-day, and thine eye has grown drowsy,
and thine upright form <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 85b.</span> and thy features and thy gait
have gone from thee!&quot; &quot;Truly not for fear nor for dread
of thee is that happened to me to-day,&quot; answered Ferdiad;
&quot;for there is not in Erin this day a warrior I could not
repel!&quot; <a name="footnotetag1_248" id="footnotetag1_248" href="#footnote1_248"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;Alas, O Ferdiad,&quot; said Cuchulain, &quot;a pity
it is for thee to oppose thy foster-brother and thy comrade
and friend, on the counsel of any woman in the world!&quot;
&quot;A pity it is, O Cuchulain,&quot; Ferdiad responded. &quot;But,
should I part without a struggle with thee, I should be in
ill repute forever with Medb and with the nobles of the four
grand provinces of Erin.&quot; &quot;A pity it is, O Ferdiad,&quot; said
Cuchulain; &quot;not on the counsel of all the men and women
in the world would I desert thee or would I do thee harm.
And almost would it make a clot of gore of my heart to be
combating with thee!&quot;<a href="#footnote1_248"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>And Cuchulain lamented and moaned, and he spake
these words and Ferdiad responded:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag1_249" id="footnotetag1_249" href="#footnote1_249"><sup>1</sup></a>After this colloquy, Ferdiad spake:<a href="#footnote1_249"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;How much soever
thou findest fault with me to-day,&quot; said Ferdiad,
<a name="footnotetag2_249" id="footnotetag2_249" href="#footnote2_249"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;for my ill-boding mien and evil doing, it will be as an
offset to my prowess.&quot; And he said,<a href="#footnote2_249"><sup>2</sup></a> &quot;To what weapons
shall we resort to-day?&quot; &quot;With thyself is the choice of
weapons to-day till night time,&quot; replied Cuchulain, &quot;for
it is I that chose on the day gone by.&quot; &quot;Let us resort,
then,&quot; said Ferdiad, &quot;to our heavy, hard-smiting swords
this day, for we trow that the smiting each other will bring
us nearer to the decision of battle to-day than was our
piercing each other on yesterday.&quot; &quot;Let us go then, by
all means,&quot; responded Cuchulain.</p>

<p>Then they took two full-great long-shields upon them
for that day. They turned to their heavy, hard-smiting
swords. Each of them fell to strike and to hew, to lay low
and cut down, to slay and undo <a name="footnotetag3_249" id="footnotetag3_249" href="#footnote3_249"><sup>3</sup></a>his fellow,<a href="#footnote3_249"><sup>3</sup></a> till as large
as the head of a month-old child was each lump and each
cut, <a name="footnotetag4_249" id="footnotetag4_249" href="#footnote4_249"><sup>4</sup></a>each clutter and each clot of gore<a href="#footnote4_249"><sup>4</sup></a> that each of them
took from the shoulders and thighs and shoulder-blades of
the other.</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_250" name="Page_250" title="250">250</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 3708.</span>
Each of them was engaged in smiting the other in this
way from the twilight of early morning till the hour of evening's
close. &quot;Let us leave off from this now, O Cuchulain!&quot;
cried Ferdiad. &quot;Aye, let us leave off, if the hour has come,&quot;
said Cuchulain. They parted <a name="footnotetag1_250" id="footnotetag1_250" href="#footnote1_250"><sup>1</sup></a>then, and<a href="#footnote1_250"><sup>1</sup></a> threw their arms
away from them into the hands of their charioteers. Though
it had been the meeting of two happy, blithe, cheerful,
joyful men, their parting that night was of two that were
sad, sorrowful and full of suffering. <a name="footnotetag2_250" id="footnotetag2_250" href="#footnote2_250"><sup>2</sup></a>They parted without
a kiss a blessing or aught other sign of friendship, and
their servants disarmed the steeds, the squires and the
heroes; no healing or curing herbs were sent from Cuchulain
to Ferdiad that night, and no food nor drink was
brought from Ferdiad to him.<a href="#footnote2_250"><sup>2</sup></a> Their horses were not in
the same paddock that night. Their charioteers were not
at the same fire.</p>

<p>They passed there that night. It was then that Ferdiad
arose early on the morrow and went alone to the ford of
combat, <a name="footnotetag3_250" id="footnotetag3_250" href="#footnote3_250"><sup>3</sup></a>and dauntless, vengeful and mighty was the man
that went thither that day, even Ferdiad son of Daman.<a href="#footnote3_250"><sup>3</sup></a>
For he knew that that would be the decisive day of the
battle and combat; and he knew that one or other of them
would fall there that day, or that they both would fall.
It was then he donned his battle-weed of battle and fight
and combat, <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 86a.</span> or ever Cuchulain came to meet him. And
thus was the manner of this harness of battle and fight and
combat: He put his silken, glossy trews with its border
of speckled gold, next to his white skin. Over this, outside,
he put his brown-leathern, well-sewed kilt. Outside of
this he put a huge, goodly flag, the size of a millstone, <a name="footnotetag4_250" id="footnotetag4_250" href="#footnote4_250"><sup>4</sup></a>the
shallow (?) stone of adamant which he had brought from
Africa and which neither points nor edges could pierce.<a href="#footnote4_250"><sup>4</sup></a>
He put his solid, very deep, iron kilt of twice molten iron
over the huge, goodly flag as large as a millstone, through
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_251" name="Page_251" title="251">251</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3730.</span>
fear and dread of the Gae Bulga on that day. About his
head he put his crested war-cap of battle and fight and
combat, whereon were forty carbuncle-gems beautifully
adorning it and studded with red-enamel and crystal and
rubies and with <a name="footnotetag1_251" id="footnotetag1_251" href="#footnote1_251"><sup>1</sup></a>shining stones<a href="#footnote1_251"><sup>1</sup></a> of the Eastern world.
His angry, fierce-striking spear he seized in his
right hand. On his left side he hung his curved battle-falchion,
<a name="footnotetag2_251" id="footnotetag2_251" href="#footnote2_251"><sup>2</sup></a>which would cut a hair against the stream with
its keenness and sharpness,<a href="#footnote2_251"><sup>2</sup></a> with its golden pommel and its
rounded hilt of red gold. On the arch-slope of his back he
slung his massive, fine-buffalo shield <a name="footnotetag3_251" id="footnotetag3_251" href="#footnote3_251"><sup>3</sup></a>of a warrior,<a href="#footnote3_251"><sup>3</sup></a>
whereon were fifty bosses, wherein a boar could be shown
in each of its bosses, apart from the great central boss of
red gold. Ferdiad performed divers, brilliant, manifold,
marvellous feats on high that day, unlearned from any one
before, neither from foster-mother nor from foster-father,
neither from Scathach nor from Uathach nor from Aif&egrave;,
but he found them of himself that day in the face of Cuchulain.</p>

<p>Cuchulain likewise came to the ford, and he beheld the
various, brilliant, manifold, wonderful feats that Ferdiad
performed on high. &quot;Thou seest yonder, O Laeg my
master, the divers, bright, numerous, marvellous feats that
Ferdiad performs on high, and I shall receive yon feats one
after the other, and, therefore, <a name="footnotetag4_251" id="footnotetag4_251" href="#footnote4_251"><sup>4</sup></a>O Laeg,&quot; cried Cuchulain,<a href="#footnote4_251"><sup>4</sup></a>
&quot;if defeat be my lot this day, do thou prick me on and taunt
me and speak evil to me, so that the more my spirit and anger
shall rise in me. If, however, before me his defeat takes
place, say thou so to me and praise me and speak me fair,
to the end that the greater may be my courage!&quot; &quot;It
shall surely be done so, if need be, O Cucuc,&quot; Laeg answered.</p>

<p>Then Cuchulain, too, girded his war-harness of battle and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_252" name="Page_252" title="252">252</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3757.</span>
fight and combat about him, and performed all kinds of
splendid, manifold, marvellous feats on high that day which
he had not learned from any one before, neither with
Scathach nor with Uathach nor with Aif&egrave;.</p>

<p>Ferdiad observed those feats, and he knew they would be
plied against him in turn. &quot;To what weapons shall we resort
<a name="footnotetag1_252" id="footnotetag1_252" href="#footnote1_252"><sup>1</sup></a>to-day<a href="#footnote1_252"><sup>1</sup></a>, O Ferdiad?&quot; asked Cuchulain. &quot;With thee is
thy choice of weapons till night time,&quot; Ferdiad responded.
&quot;Let us go to the 'Feat of the Ford,' then,&quot; said Cuchulain.
&quot;Aye, let us do so,&quot; answered Ferdiad. Albeit
Ferdiad spoke that, he deemed it the most grievous thing
whereto he could go, for he knew that in that sort Cuchulain
used to destroy every hero and every battle-soldier who
fought with him in the 'Feat of the Ford.'</p>

<p>Great indeed was the deed that was done on the ford
that day. The two heroes, the two champions, the two
chariot-fighters of the west of Europe, the two bright
torches of valour of the Gael, the two hands of dispensing
favour and of giving rewards <a name="footnotetag2_252" id="footnotetag2_252" href="#footnote2_252"><sup>2</sup></a>and jewels and treasures<a href="#footnote2_252"><sup>2</sup></a>
in the west of the northern world, <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 86b.</span> <a name="footnotetag3_252" id="footnotetag3_252" href="#footnote3_252"><sup>3</sup></a>the two veterans<a href="#footnote3_252"><sup>3</sup></a>
of skill and the two keys of bravery of the Gael, <a name="footnotetag4_252" id="footnotetag4_252" href="#footnote4_252"><sup>4</sup></a>the man
for quelling the variance and discord of Connacht, the man
for guarding the cattle and herds of Ulster<a href="#footnote4_252"><sup>4</sup></a>, to be brought
together in encounter as from afar, <a name="footnotetag5_252" id="footnotetag5_252" href="#footnote5_252"><sup>5</sup></a>set to slay each other
or to kill one of them<a href="#footnote5_252"><sup>5</sup></a>, through the sowing of dissension
and the incitement of Ailill and Medb.</p>

<p>Each of them was busy hurling at the other in those
deeds of arms from early morning's gloaming till the middle
of noon. When mid-day came, the rage of the men became
wild, and each drew nearer to the other.</p>

<p>Thereupon Cuchulain gave one spring once from the
bank of the ford till he stood upon the boss of Ferdiad
macDaman's shield, seeking to reach his head and to strike
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_253" name="Page_253" title="253">253</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3779.</span>
it from above over the rim of the shield. Straightway
Ferdiad gave the shield a blow with his left elbow, so that
Cuchulain went from him like a bird onto the brink of the
ford. Again Cuchulain sprang from the brink of the ford,
so that he alighted upon the boss of Ferdiad macDaman's
shield, that he might reach his head and strike it over the
rim of the shield from above. Ferdiad gave the shield
a thrust with his left knee, so that Cuchulain went from
him like an infant onto the bank of the ford.</p>

<p>Laeg espied that. &quot;Woe then, <a name="footnotetag1_253" id="footnotetag1_253" href="#footnote1_253"><sup>1</sup></a>O Cuchulain!&quot;<a href="#footnote1_253"><sup>1</sup></a> cried
Laeg; <a name="footnotetag2_253" id="footnotetag2_253" href="#footnote2_253"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;meseems<a href="#footnote2_253"><sup>2</sup></a> the battle-warrior that is against thee
hath shaken thee as a fond woman shakes her child. He
hath washed thee as a cup is washed in a tub. He hath
ground thee as a mill grinds soft malt. He hath pierced
thee as a tool bores through an oak. He hath bound thee
as the bindweed binds the trees. He hath pounced on thee
as a hawk pounces on little birds, so that no more hast thou
right or title or claim to valour or skill in arms till the very
day of doom and of life, thou little imp of an elf-man!&quot;
cried Laeg.</p>

<p>Thereat for the third time, Cuchulain arose with the
speed of the wind, and the swiftness of a swallow, and the
dash of a dragon, and the strength (of a lion) <a name="footnotetag3_253" id="footnotetag3_253" href="#footnote3_253"><sup>3</sup></a>into the clouds<a href="#footnote3_253"><sup>3</sup></a>
of the air, till he alighted on the boss of the shield of Ferdiad
son of Daman, so as to reach his head that he might strike
it from above over the rim of his shield. Then it was
that the battle-warrior gave the shield a <a name="footnotetag4_253" id="footnotetag4_253" href="#footnote4_253"><sup>4</sup></a>violent and powerful<a href="#footnote4_253"><sup>4</sup></a>
shake, so that Cuchulain flew from it into the middle
of the ford, the same as if he had not sprung at all.</p>

<p>It was then the first twisting-fit of Cuchulain took place,
so that a swelling and inflation filled him like breath in a
bladder, until he made a dreadful, terrible, many-coloured,
wonderful bow of himself, so that as big as a giant or a man
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_254" name="Page_254" title="254">254</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3805.</span>
of the sea was the hugely-brave warrior towering directly
over Ferdiad.</p>

<p>Such was the closeness of the combat they made, that
their heads encountered above and their feet below and
their hands in the middle over the rims and bosses of the
shields.</p>

<p>Such was the closeness of the combat they made, that
their shields burst and split from their rims to their centres.</p>

<p>Such was the closeness of the combat they made, that
their spears bent and turned and shivered from their tips
to their rivets.</p>

<p>Such was the closeness of the combat they made, that
the boccanach and the bananach ('the puck-faced Fays'
and 'the white-faced Fays') and the sprites of the glens
and the eldritch beings of the air screamed from the rims
of their shields and from the guards of their swords and
from the tips of their spears.</p>

<p>Such was the closeness of the combat they made, that
they forced the river out of its bed and out of its course,
so that there might have been a reclining place <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 87a.</span> for a king
or a queen in the middle of the ford, and not a drop of water
was in it but what fell there with the trampling and slipping
which the two heroes and the two battle-warriors made in
the middle of the ford.</p>

<p>Such was the closeness of the combat they made, that
the steeds of the Gael broke loose affrighted and plunging
with madness and fury, so that their chains and their
shackles, their traces and tethers snapped, and the women
and children and pygmy-folk, the weak and the madmen
among the men of Erin brake out through the camp south-westward.</p>

<p>At that time they were at the edge-feat of swords. It
was then Ferdiad caught Cuchulain in an unguarded moment,
and he gave him a thrust with his tusk-hilted blade, so that
he buried it in his breast, and his blood fell into his belt,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_255" name="Page_255" title="255">255</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3831.</span>
till the ford became crimsoned with the clotted blood from
the battle-warrior's body. Cuchulain endured it not, under
Ferdiad's attack, with his death-bringing, heavy blows, and
his long strokes and his mighty, middle slashes at him.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag1_255" id="footnotetag1_255" href="#footnote1_255"><sup>1</sup></a>Then Cuchulain bethought him of his friends from
Faery and of his mighty folk who would come to defend
him and of his scholars to protect him, what time he would
be hard pressed in the combat. It was then that Dolb and
Indolb arrived to help and to succour their friend, namely
Cuchulain, <a name="footnotetag2_255" id="footnotetag2_255" href="#footnote2_255"><sup>2</sup></a>and one of them went on either side of him
and they smote Ferdiad, the three of them, and Ferdiad
did not perceive the men from Sid ('the Faery Dwelling')<a href="#footnote2_255"><sup>2</sup></a>.
Then it was that Ferdiad felt the onset of the three together
smiting his shield against him, and he gave all his care and
attention thereto, and thence he called to mind that, when
they were with Scathach and with Uathach <a name="footnotetag3_255" id="footnotetag3_255" href="#footnote3_255"><sup>3</sup></a>learning
together, Dolb and Indolb used to come to help Cuchulain
out of every stress wherein he was.<a href="#footnote3_255"><sup>3</sup></a> Ferdiad spake:
&quot;Not alike are our foster-brothership and our comradeship,
O Cuchulain,&quot; quoth he. &quot;How so, then?&quot; asked Cuchulain.
&quot;Thy friends of the Fairy-folk have succoured thee,
and thou didst not disclose them to me before,&quot; said Ferdiad.
&quot;Not easy for me were that,&quot; answered Cuchulain; &quot;for
if the magic veil be once revealed to one of the sons of
Mil&egrave;,<a name="footnotetaga_255" id="footnotetaga_255" href="#footnotea_255"><sup>a</sup></a> none of the Tuatha De Danann ('the Folk of the
Goddess Danu') will have power to practise concealment or
magic. And why complainest thou here, <a name="footnotetag4_255" id="footnotetag4_255" href="#footnote4_255"><sup>4</sup></a>O Ferdiad?&quot;
said Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote4_255"><sup>4</sup></a> &quot;Thou hast a horn skin whereby to
multiply feats and deeds of arms on me, and thou hast
not shown me how it is closed or how it is opened.&quot;</p>

<p>Then it was they displayed all their skill and secret
cunning to one another, so that there was not a secret of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_256" name="Page_256" title="256">256</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3851.</span>
either of them kept from the other except the Gae Bulga,
which was Cuchulain's. Howbeit, when the Fairy friends
found Cuchulain had been wounded, each of them inflicted
three great, heavy wounds on him, on Ferdiad, to wit.
It was then that Ferdiad made a cast to the right, so that
he slew Dolb with that goodly cast. Then followed the
two woundings and the two throws that overcame him,
till Ferdiad made a second throw towards Cuchulain's left,
and with that throw he stretched low and killed Indolb dead
on the floor of the ford. Hence it is that the story-teller
sang the rann:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div>&quot;Why is this called Ferdiad's Ford,</div>
<div>E'en though three men on it fell?</div>
<div>None the less it washed their spoils&mdash;</div>
<div>It is Dolb's and Indolb's Ford!&quot;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What need to relate further! When the devoted,
equally great sires<a name="footnotetaga_256" id="footnotetaga_256" href="#footnotea_256"><sup>a</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_256" id="footnotetag2_256" href="#footnote2_256"><sup>2</sup></a>and champions,<a href="#footnote2_256"><sup>2</sup></a> and the hard, battle-victorious
wild beasts that fought for Cuchulain had fallen,
it greatly strengthened the courage of Ferdiad, so that he
gave two blows for every blow of Cuchulain's. When Laeg
son of Riangabair saw his lord being overcome by the
crushing blows of the champion who oppressed him, Laeg
began to stir up and rebuke Cuchulain, in such a way that
a swelling and an inflation filled Cuchulain <a name="footnotetag3_256" id="footnotetag3_256" href="#footnote3_256"><sup>3</sup></a>from top to
ground,<a href="#footnote3_256"><sup>3</sup></a> as the wind fills a spread, open banner, so that
he made a dreadful, wonderful bow of himself like a sky-bow
in a shower of rain, and he made for Ferdiad with the
violence of a dragon or the strength of a blood-hound.<a name="footnotetag1_256" id="footnotetag1_256" href="#footnote1_256"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>And Cuchulain called for the Gae Bulga from Laeg son
of Riangabair. This was its nature: With the stream
it was made ready, and from between the fork of the foot
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_257" name="Page_257" title="257">257</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3874.</span>
it was cast; the wound of a single spear it gave when entering
the body, and thirty<a name="footnotetaga_257" id="footnotetaga_257" href="#footnotea_257"><sup>a</sup></a> barbs had it when it opened,
and it could not be drawn out of a man's flesh till <a name="footnotetag1_257" id="footnotetag1_257" href="#footnote1_257"><sup>1</sup></a>the
flesh<a href="#footnote1_257"><sup>1</sup></a> had been cut about it.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag2_257" id="footnotetag2_257" href="#footnote2_257"><sup>2</sup></a>Thereupon Laeg came forward to the brink of the river
and to the place where the fresh water was dammed, and
the Gae Bulga was sharpened and set in position. He
filled the pool and stopped the stream and checked the
tide of the ford. Ferdiad's charioteer watched the work,
for Ferdiad had said to him early <a name="footnotetag3_257" id="footnotetag3_257" href="#footnote3_257"><sup>3</sup></a>in the morning:<a href="#footnote3_257"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;Now,
gilla, do thou hold back Laeg from me to-day, and I will
hold back Cuchulain from thee <a name="footnotetag4_257" id="footnotetag4_257" href="#footnote4_257"><sup>4</sup></a>and thy men forever.&quot;<a href="#footnote4_257"><sup>4</sup></a>
&quot;This is a pity,&quot; quoth the henchman; &quot;no match for
him am I; for a man to combat a hundred is he <a name="footnotetag5_257" id="footnotetag5_257" href="#footnote5_257"><sup>5</sup></a>amongst
the men of Erin,<a href="#footnote5_257"><sup>5</sup></a> and that am I not. Still, however slight
his help, it shall not come to his lord past me.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag6_257" id="footnotetag6_257" href="#footnote6_257"><sup>6</sup></a>Thus were the henchmen: two brothers were they,
namely, Id<a name="footnotetagb_257" id="footnotetagb_257" href="#footnoteb_257"><sup>b</sup></a> son of Riangabair, and Laeg<a name="footnotetagc_257" id="footnotetagc_257" href="#footnotec_257"><sup>c</sup></a> son of Riangabair.
As for Id son of Riangabair,<a href="#footnote6_257"><sup>6</sup></a> he was then watching his
brother <a name="footnotetag7_257" id="footnotetag7_257" href="#footnote7_257"><sup>7</sup></a>thus making the dam<a href="#footnote7_257"><sup>7</sup></a> till he filled the pools and
went to set the Gae Bulga downwards. It was then that
Id went up and released the stream and opened the dam
and undid the fixing of the Gae Bulga. Cuchulain became
deep purple and red all over when he saw the setting undone
on the Gae Bulga. He sprang from the top of the ground
so that he alighted light and quick on the rim of Ferdiad's
shield. Ferdiad gave a <a name="footnotetag8_257" id="footnotetag8_257" href="#footnote8_257"><sup>8</sup></a>strong<a href="#footnote8_257"><sup>8</sup></a> shake to the shield, so
that he hurled Cuchulain the measure of nine paces out
to the westward over the ford. Then Cuchulain called and
shouted to Laeg to set about preparing the Gae Bulga for
him. Laeg hastened to the pool and began the work. Id
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_258" name="Page_258" title="258">258</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3895.</span>
ran and opened the dam and released it before the stream.
Laeg sprang at his brother and they grappled on the spot.
Laeg threw Id and handled him sorely, for he was loath to
use weapons upon him. Ferdiad pursued Cuchulain westwards
over the ford. Cuchulain sprang on the rim of the
shield. Ferdiad shook the shield, so that he sent Cuchulain
the space of nine paces eastwards over the ford. Cuchulain
called and shouted to Laeg, <a name="footnotetag1_258" id="footnotetag1_258" href="#footnote1_258"><sup>1</sup></a>and bade him stop the stream
and make ready the spear.<a href="#footnote1_258"><sup>1</sup></a> Laeg attempted to come nigh
it, but Ferdiad's charioteer let him not, so that Laeg turned
on him and left him on the sedgy bottom of the ford. He
gave him many a heavy blow with clenched fist on the face
and countenance, so that he broke his mouth and his nose
and put out his eyes and his sight, <a name="footnotetag3_258" id="footnotetag3_258" href="#footnote3_258"><sup>3</sup></a>and left him lying
wounded (?) and full of terror.<a href="#footnote3_258"><sup>3</sup></a> And forthwith Laeg left
him and filled the pool and checked the stream and stilled
the noise of the river's voice, and set in position the Gae
Bulga. After some time Ferdiad's charioteer arose from
his death-cloud, and set his hand on his face and countenance,
and he looked away towards the ford of combat and
saw Laeg fixing the Gae Bulga. He ran again to the pool
and made a breach in the dike quickly and speedily, so that
the river burst out in its booming, bounding, bellying, bank-breaking
billows making its own wild course. Cuchulain
became purple and red all over when he saw the setting of
the Gae Bulga had been disturbed, and for the third time
he sprang from the top of the ground and alighted on the
edge of Ferdiad's shield, so as to strike him over the shield
from above. Ferdiad gave a blow with his left knee against
the leather of the bare shield, so that Cuchulain was thrown
into the waves of the ford.</p>

<p>Thereupon Ferdiad gave three severe woundings to Cuchulain.
Cuchulain cried and shouted <a name="footnotetag4_258" id="footnotetag4_258" href="#footnote4_258"><sup>4</sup></a>loudly<a href="#footnote4_258"><sup>4</sup></a> to Laeg to
make ready the Gae Bulga for him. Laeg attempted to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_259" name="Page_259" title="259">259</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3919.</span>
get near it, but Ferdiad's charioteer prevented him. Then
Laeg grew <a name="footnotetag1_259" id="footnotetag1_259" href="#footnote1_259"><sup>1</sup></a>very<a href="#footnote1_259"><sup>1</sup></a> wroth <a name="footnotetag3_259" id="footnotetag3_259" href="#footnote3_259"><sup>3</sup></a>at his brother<a href="#footnote3_259"><sup>3</sup></a> and he made a
spring at him, and he closed his long, full-valiant hands
over him, so that he quickly threw him to the ground and
straightway <a name="footnotetag4_259" id="footnotetag4_259" href="#footnote4_259"><sup>4</sup></a>bound<a href="#footnote4_259"><sup>4</sup></a> him. And <a name="footnotetag5_259" id="footnotetag5_259" href="#footnote5_259"><sup>5</sup></a>then<a href="#footnote5_259"><sup>5</sup></a> he went from
him quickly and courageously, so that he filled the pool
and stayed the stream and set the Gae Bulga. And he
cried out to Cuchulain that it was served, for it was not to
be discharged without a quick word of warning before it.
Hence it is that Laeg cried out:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div>&quot;Ware! beware the Gae Bulga,</div>

</div>

<p><a name="footnotetag6_259" id="footnotetag6_259" href="#footnote6_259"><sup>6</sup></a>And he sent it to Cuchulain along the stream.<a href="#footnote6_259"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Then it was that Cuchulain let fly the white Gae Bulga
from the fork of his irresistible right foot. <a name="footnotetag7_259" id="footnotetag7_259" href="#footnote7_259"><sup>7</sup></a>Ferdiad began
to defend the ford against Cuchulain, so that the noble Cu
arose with the swiftness of a swallow and the wail of the
storm-play in the rafters of the firmament, so that he laid
hold of the breadth of his two feet of the bed of the ford,
in spite of the champion.<a href="#footnote7_259"><sup>7</sup></a> Ferdiad prepared for the feat
according to the testimony thereof. He lowered his shield,
so that the spear went over its edge into the watery, water-cold
river. And he looked at Cuchulain, and he saw all his
various, venomous feats made ready, and he knew not to
which of them he should first give answer, whether to the
'Fist's breast-spear,' or to the 'Wild shield's broad-spear,'
or to the 'Short spear from the middle of the palm,' or to
the white Gae Bulga over the fair, watery river.<a name="footnotetag2_259" id="footnotetag2_259" href="#footnote2_259"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag8_259" id="footnotetag8_259" href="#footnote8_259"><sup>8</sup></a>When Ferdiad saw that his gilla had been thrown<a href="#footnote8_259"><sup>8</sup></a>
and heard the Gae Bulga called for, he thrust his shield
down to protect the lower part of his body. Cuchulain
gripped the short spear <a name="footnotetag9_259" id="footnotetag9_259" href="#footnote9_259"><sup>9</sup></a>which was in his hand,<a href="#footnote9_259"><sup>9</sup></a> cast it
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_260" name="Page_260" title="260">260</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 3938.</span>
off the palm of his hand over the rim of the shield and over
the edge of the <a name="footnotetag1_260" id="footnotetag1_260" href="#footnote1_260"><sup>1</sup></a>corselet and<a href="#footnote1_260"><sup>1</sup></a> horn-skin, so that its farther
half was visible after piercing his heart in his bosom. Ferdiad
gave a thrust of his shield upwards to protect the upper
part of his body, though it was help that came too late.
The gilla set the Gae Bulga down the stream, and Cuchulain
caught it in the fork of his foot, and <a name="footnotetag2_260" id="footnotetag2_260" href="#footnote2_260"><sup>2</sup></a>when Ferdiad raised
his shield<a href="#footnote2_260"><sup>2</sup></a> Cuchulain threw the Gae Bulga as far as he could
cast <a name="footnotetag3_260" id="footnotetag3_260" href="#footnote3_260"><sup>3</sup></a>underneath<a href="#footnote3_260"><sup>3</sup></a> at Ferdiad, so that it passed through
the strong, thick, iron apron of wrought iron, and broke in
three parts the huge, goodly stone the size of a millstone,
so that it cut its way through the body's protection into
him, till every joint and every limb was filled with its barbs.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, that now sufficeth,&quot; sighed Ferdiad: &quot;I am fallen
of that! But, yet one thing more: mightily didst thou
drive with thy right foot. And 'twas not fair of thee for
me to fall by thy hand.&quot; And he yet spake and uttered
these words:&mdash;</p>

Thereupon Cuchulain hastened towards Ferdiad and
clasped his two arms about him, and bore him with all his
arms and his armour and his dress northwards over the
ford, that so it should be <a name="footnotetag1_261" id="footnotetag1_261" href="#footnote1_261"><sup>1</sup></a>with his face<a href="#footnote1_261"><sup>1</sup></a> to the north<a name="footnotetaga_261" id="footnotetaga_261" href="#footnotea_261"><sup>a</sup></a> of

on the ground, and a cloud and a faint and a swoon came
over Cuchulain there by the head of Ferdiad. Laeg espied
it, and the men of Erin all arose for the attack upon him.

Fergus answered; &quot;meseems it is Cethern son of <a name="footnotetag6_270" id="footnotetag6_270" href="#footnote6_270"><sup>6</sup></a>generous,

him!&quot;<a href="#footnote8_270"><sup>8</sup></a> Fergus indeed spoke true, that it was Fintan's
son Cethern that was come there. And so Cethern son
of Fintan came on them, and the camp and the garrison
were confounded and he wounded all around him in every
direction and on all sides <a name="footnotetag9_270" id="footnotetag9_270" href="#footnote9_270"><sup>9</sup></a>and they wounded him in like
manner.<a href="#footnote9_270"><sup>9</sup></a> And then <a name="footnotetag10_270" id="footnotetag10_270" href="#footnote10_270"><sup>10</sup></a>Cethern<a href="#footnote10_270"><sup>10</sup></a> left them, <a name="footnotetag11_270" id="footnotetag11_270" href="#footnote11_270"><sup>11</sup></a>and it was

<a name="footnotetag12_270" id="footnotetag12_270" href="#footnote12_270"><sup>12</sup></a>and his intestines were wound about his legs.<a href="#footnote12_270"><sup>12</sup></a> He came
to the place where was Cuchulain, to be healed and cured,

him. <a name="footnotetag13_270" id="footnotetag13_270" href="#footnote13_270"><sup>13</sup></a>Cuchulain had compassion on his wounds;<a href="#footnote13_270"><sup>13</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag14_270" id="footnotetag14_270" href="#footnote14_270"><sup>14</sup></a> a

Erin and summon <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 89.</span> the leeches to come out to cure Cethern

<p>Laeg went his way to the quarters and camp of the men
of Erin, and he called upon the leeches of the men of Erin
to go forth to cure Cethern son of Fintan. Truth to
tell, the leeches of the men of Erin were unwilling to
go cure their adversary, their enemy and their stranger-foe.
But they feared Cuchulain would work death and
destruction and slaughter upon them if they went not.
And so they went. As one man of them <a name="footnotetag2_271" id="footnotetag2_271" href="#footnote2_271"><sup>2</sup></a>after the other<a href="#footnote2_271"><sup>2</sup></a>

Yea, even the fifteenth leech, it was but the tip of a blow
that reached him. Yet he fell lifeless of the great stun
between the bodies of the other physicians and lay there
for a long space and time. Ithall, leech of Ailill and Medb,
was his name.</p>

<p>Thereafter Cethern son of Fintan asked another leech
of Cuchulain to heal and to cure him <a name="footnotetag1_272" id="footnotetag1_272" href="#footnote1_272"><sup>1</sup></a>forasmuch as the
leeches of the men of Erin had failed him.<a href="#footnote1_272"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;Come, master

<p>Laeg hastened to Fingin the seer-leech at 'Fingin's
Grave-mound' at Leccan of Sliab Fuait, to the leech of
Conchobar. And he told him to go cure Cethern son of
Fintan. Thereupon Fingin the prophet-leech came <a name="footnotetag3_272" id="footnotetag3_272" href="#footnote3_272"><sup>3</sup></a>with
him to where Cuchulain and Cethern were.<a href="#footnote3_272"><sup>3</sup></a> As soon as he
was come, Cethern son of Fintan showed him his stabs

<a name="footnotetag2_273" id="footnotetag2_273" href="#footnote2_273"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;Look at this bloody wound for me, O Fingin,&quot; said
Cethern.<a href="#footnote2_273"><sup>2</sup></a> Fingin looked at the bloody wound. &quot;Why, it
is a slight, unwillingly given wound we behold here,&quot; said
the leech; <a name="footnotetag3_273" id="footnotetag3_273" href="#footnote3_273"><sup>3</sup></a>&quot;even a wound that some one of thine own
blood hath given thee, and no desire or wish had he therefor,<a href="#footnote3_273"><sup>3</sup></a>
and it will not carry thee off at once.&quot; &quot;That, now,
is true,&quot; exclaimed Cethern. &quot;A lone man came upon
me there; bushy hair on him; a blue mantle wrapped
around him; a silver brooch in the mantle over his
breast; an oval shield with plaited rim he bore; a five-pointed
spear in his hand; a pronged spare spear at his
side. He gave this bloody wound. He bore away a slight
wound from me too.&quot; &quot;Why, we know that man!&quot; cried
Cuchulain; &quot;'twas Illann Ilarchless ('Illann of many
feats') son of Fergus <a name="footnotetag4_273" id="footnotetag4_273" href="#footnote4_273"><sup>4</sup></a>macRoig.<a href="#footnote4_273"><sup>4</sup></a> And he would not wish
that thou shouldst fall by his hand, but he gave thee this
mock-blow that the men of Erin might not have it to say it
was to betray them or to forsake them if he gave it not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now look at this bloody wound for me, O Fingin my
master,&quot; said Cethern. Fingin looked closely into the
bloody wound. &quot;Why, 'tis a woman's wanton deed of
arms we behold here,&quot; said the leech; <a name="footnotetag5_273" id="footnotetag5_273" href="#footnote5_273"><sup>5</sup></a>&quot;namely the
wound which a warrior-woman inflicted on thee,&quot; said
he.<a href="#footnote5_273"><sup>5</sup></a> &quot;Aye, that is true then,&quot; quoth Cethern; &quot;a woman
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_274" name="Page_274" title="274">274</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 4314.</span>
came upon me there by herself. A woman, beautiful, fair-faced,
long-cheeked, tall; a golden-yellow head of hair
<a name="footnotetag1_274" id="footnotetag1_274" href="#footnote1_274"><sup>1</sup></a>down to the top of her two shoulder-blades she wore;
a smock of royal sammet next to her white skin;<a href="#footnote1_274"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_274" id="footnotetag2_274" href="#footnote2_274"><sup>2</sup></a>two
birds of gold on her shoulders;<a href="#footnote2_274"><sup>2</sup></a> a purple cloak without
other colour she had around her; <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 90a.</span> a brooch of gold in the
cloak over her bosom; a straight, ridged spear, red-flaming
in her hand. She it was that gave me this bloody wound.
She bore away a slight wound from me too.&quot; &quot;Ah, but we
know that woman,&quot; cried Cuchulain; &quot;Medb daughter
of Eocho Fedlech, daughter of the High King of Erin; it is
she that came unto us in that dress. A victory and triumph
and trophy she had considered it hadst thou fallen at her
hands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look at this bloody wound for me too, O Fingin my
master,&quot; said Cethern. Fingin looked at the bloody wound.
&quot;Why, the feat of arms of two warriors is this,&quot; said the
leech; <a name="footnotetag3_274" id="footnotetag3_274" href="#footnote3_274"><sup>3</sup></a>&quot;that is to say, two warriors inflicted these two
wounds as one wound upon thee.&quot;<a href="#footnote3_274"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;Yea, that is true,&quot;
answered Cethern. &quot;There came two <a name="footnotetag4_274" id="footnotetag4_274" href="#footnote4_274"><sup>4</sup></a>men-at-arms<a href="#footnote4_274"><sup>4</sup></a>
upon me in that place; two, with bushy hair on them;
two blue cloaks wrapped around them; brooches of
silver in the cloaks over their breasts; a necklace of all-white
silver around the neck of each of them; <a name="footnotetag5_274" id="footnotetag5_274" href="#footnote5_274"><sup>5</sup></a>two long
shields they bore; two hard chains of silver on each of
them; a band of silver around them; two five-pointed
spears they bore; a vein of silver around them.<a href="#footnote5_274"><sup>5</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag6_274" id="footnotetag6_274" href="#footnote6_274"><sup>6</sup></a>They
smote me this wound and I smote a little wound on each of
them.&quot;<a href="#footnote6_274"><sup>6</sup></a> &quot;Indeed we know that pair,&quot; quoth Cuchulain;
&quot;Oll and Othin&egrave; they, of the bodyguard of Ailill and Medb;
they never go to a hosting, <a name="footnotetag7_274" id="footnotetag7_274" href="#footnote7_274"><sup>7</sup></a>to battle or combat,<a href="#footnote7_274"><sup>7</sup></a> but when
the wounding of a man is certain. They would have held
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_275" name="Page_275" title="275">275</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 4330.</span>
it for victory and triumph and a boast hadst thou fallen
at their hands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look on this bloody wound also for me, O Fingin my
master,&quot; said Cethern. Fingin looked closely at the bloody
wound. &quot;There came upon me a pair of young warriors
of the Fian,&quot; <a name="footnotetag1_275" id="footnotetag1_275" href="#footnote1_275"><sup>1</sup></a>said Cethern;<a href="#footnote1_275"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;a splendid, manly appearance
they had. Each of them cast a spear at me. I drave
this spear through the one of them.&quot; Fingin looked into
the bloody wound. &quot;Why, this blood is all black,&quot;
quoth the leech; &quot;through thy heart those spears passed
so that they formed a cross of themselves through thy heart,
<a name="footnotetag2_275" id="footnotetag2_275" href="#footnote2_275"><sup>2</sup></a>and thy healing and curing are not easy;<a href="#footnote2_275"><sup>2</sup></a> and I prophesy
no cure here, but I would get thee some healing plants and
curing charms that they destroy thee not forthwith.&quot;
&quot;Ah, but we know them, that pair,&quot; quoth Cuchulain;
&quot;Bun and Mecconn ('Stump' and 'Root') are they, of the
bodyguard of Ailill and Medb. It was their hope that
thou shouldst fall at their hands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look at this bloody wound for me, too, O Fingin my
master,&quot; said Cethern. Fingin examined the bloody wound.
&quot;Why, it is the red rush of the two sons of Ri Cail&egrave; ('the
King of the Woods') that is here,&quot; said the leech. &quot;Aye,
'tis so,&quot; replied Cethern; &quot;there attacked me there two
fair-faced, dark-browed youths, huge, with diadems of
gold <a name="footnotetag3_275" id="footnotetag3_275" href="#footnote3_275"><sup>3</sup></a>on their heads.<a href="#footnote3_275"><sup>3</sup></a> Two green mantles folded about
them; two pins of bright silver on the mantles over their
breasts; two five-pronged spears in their hands.&quot; &quot;Why,
near each other are the bloody wounds they gave thee,&quot;
said the leech; &quot;into thy gullet they went, so that the
points of the spears struck one another within thee, and
none the easier is it to work thy cure here.&quot; &quot;We know
that pair,&quot; quoth Cuchulain; <a name="footnotetag4_275" id="footnotetag4_275" href="#footnote4_275"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;noble youths of Medb's
great household,<a href="#footnote4_275"><sup>4</sup></a> Broen and Brudni, are they, <a name="footnotetag5_275" id="footnotetag5_275" href="#footnote5_275"><sup>5</sup></a>two<a href="#footnote5_275"><sup>5</sup></a>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_276" name="Page_276" title="276">276</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 4352.</span>
sons of Ri teora Soillse ('the King of the three Lights'), that
is, the two sons of the King of the Woods. It had been
victory and triumph and a boast for them, hadst thou
fallen at their hands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look at this bloody wound for me, too, my good
Fingin,&quot; said Cethern. Fingin looked into the bloody
wound. &quot;The joint deed of two brothers is here,&quot; said the
leech. &quot;'Tis indeed true,&quot; replied Cethern. &quot;There came
upon me two leading, king's warriors. Yellow hair upon
them; dark-grey mantles with fringes, wrapped around
them; leaf-shaped brooches of silvered bronze in the
mantles over their breasts; broad, grey lances in their
hands.&quot; &quot;Ah, but we know that pair,&quot; quoth Cuchulain;
&quot;Cormac Colomon rig ('King's pillar') is the one, and
Cormac son of Mael Foga, of the bodyguard of Ailill and
Medb (the other). What they sought was that thou shouldst
fall at their hands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look at this bloody wound for me too, O Fingin my
master,&quot; said Cethern. <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 90b.</span> Fingin looked into that bloody
wound. &quot;The assault of two brothers is here,&quot; said the
leech. &quot;Aye then, 'tis true,&quot; answered Cethern. &quot;There
came upon me two tender youths there; very much alike
were they; curly <a name="footnotetag1_276" id="footnotetag1_276" href="#footnote1_276"><sup>1</sup></a>dark<a href="#footnote1_276"><sup>1</sup></a> hair on the one of them; curly
yellow hair on the other; two green cloaks wrapped around
them; two bright-silver brooches in the cloaks over their
breasts; two tunics of smooth yellow silk <a name="footnotetag2_276" id="footnotetag2_276" href="#footnote2_276"><sup>2</sup></a>with hoods
and red embroidery<a href="#footnote2_276"><sup>2</sup></a> next their skin; <a name="footnotetag3_276" id="footnotetag3_276" href="#footnote3_276"><sup>3</sup></a>two<a href="#footnote3_276"><sup>3</sup></a> white-hilted
swords at their belts; two bright shields having the likenesses
of beasts in white silver they bore; two five-pronged
spears with veins of all-white silver in their hands.&quot; &quot;Ah,
but we know that pair,&quot; quoth Cuchulain; &quot;Man&egrave; 'Like
to his mother' and Man&egrave; 'Like to his father,' two sons of
Ailill and Medb; and it would be matter of victory,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_277" name="Page_277" title="277">277</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 4377.</span>
triumph and boasting to them, hadst thou fallen at their
hands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look at this bloody wound for me, too, O Fingin my
master,&quot; said Cethern. &quot;There came upon me a pair of
young warriors of the Fian there. A brilliant appearance,
stately-tall and manlike, they had; wonderful garments from
far-away countries upon them. Each of them thrust <a name="footnotetag1_277" id="footnotetag1_277" href="#footnote1_277"><sup>1</sup></a>the
spear he had<a href="#footnote1_277"><sup>1</sup></a> at me. <a name="footnotetag2_277" id="footnotetag2_277" href="#footnote2_277"><sup>2</sup></a>Then<a href="#footnote2_277"><sup>2</sup></a> I thrust <a name="footnotetag3_277" id="footnotetag3_277" href="#footnote3_277"><sup>3</sup></a>this spear<a href="#footnote3_277"><sup>3</sup></a>
through each of them.&quot; Fingin looked into the bloody
wound. &quot;Cunning are the bloody wounds they inflicted
upon thee,&quot; said the leech; &quot;they have severed the strings
of thy heart within thee, so that thy heart rolls about in
thy breast like an apple in motion or like a ball of yarn in
an empty bag, and there is no string at all to support it;
<a name="footnotetag4_277" id="footnotetag4_277" href="#footnote4_277"><sup>4</sup></a>and there is no means to cure thee or to save thee,<a href="#footnote4_277"><sup>4</sup></a> and
no healing can I effect here.&quot; &quot;Ah, but we know those
twain,&quot; quoth Cuchulain; &quot;a pair of champions from
Norway who, <a name="footnotetag5_277" id="footnotetag5_277" href="#footnote5_277"><sup>5</sup></a>because of their cunning and violence,<a href="#footnote5_277"><sup>5</sup></a> have
been sent particularly by Ailill and Medb to slay thee;
for not often does one ever issue alive from their combats,
and it would be their will that thou shouldst fall at their
hands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look upon this bloody wound for me too, my good
Fingin,&quot; said Cethern. Fingin looked at that bloody wound
in like manner. &quot;Why, the alternate woundings of a son
and his father we behold here,&quot; answered the leech. &quot;Yea,
it is so,&quot; quoth Cethern; &quot;two tall men, red as torches,
came upon me there, with diadems of burnished gold upon
them; kingly garments they wore; gold-hilted, hammered
swords at their girdles, with scabbards of pure-white silver,
<a name="footnotetag6_277" id="footnotetag6_277" href="#footnote6_277"><sup>6</sup></a>with a cunningly ornamented and delicate embossing<a href="#footnote6_277"><sup>6</sup></a>
and supports of mottled gold outside upon them. &quot;Ah,
but we know that pair,&quot; quoth Cuchulain; &quot;Ailill and his
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_278" name="Page_278" title="278">278</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 4399.</span>
son are they, Man&egrave; 'That embraces the traits of them all.'
They would deem it victory and triumph and a boast
shouldst thou fall at their hands.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus far the &quot;Bloody Wounds&quot; of the T&aacute;in.</p>

<p>&quot;Speak, O Fingin prophetic leech,&quot; spake Cethern son
of Fintan; &quot;what verdict and what counsel givest me
now?&quot; &quot;This verily is what I say to thee,&quot; replied Fingin
the prophetic leech: &quot;Count not on thy big cows for yearlings
this year; for if thou dost, it is not thou that will
enjoy them, and no profit will they bring thee.&quot; &quot;This
is the judgement and counsel the other surgeons did give
me, and certain it is it brought them neither advantage nor
profit, and they fell at my hands; and none the more will
it bring thee advantage or profit, and thou shalt fall at
my hands!&quot; And he gave Fingin a strong, stiff kick
with his foot, and sent him between the chariot's two wheels
<a name="footnotetag1_278" id="footnotetag1_278" href="#footnote1_278"><sup>1</sup></a>and the creaking of the chariot might be heard afar
off.<a href="#footnote1_278"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but vicious is the kick from the old warrior,&quot;
cried Cuchulain; <a name="footnotetag2_278" id="footnotetag2_278" href="#footnote2_278"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;'twould be more fitting if thou
shouldst ply it on foes than on leech!&quot;<a href="#footnote2_278"><sup>2</sup></a> Hence, from this
saying, is the name Uachtar Lua ('the Height of the Kick')
in the land of Ross from then until this day.

Nevertheless <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 91a.</span> Fingin the prophet-leech gave his choice
to Cethern son of Fintan: A long illness for him and afterwards
to obtain help and succour, or a red<a name="footnotetaga_278" id="footnotetaga_278" href="#footnotea_278"><sup>a</sup></a> healing for the
space of three days and three nights, so that he might then
employ his strength on his enemies. What Cethern son
of Fintan chose was a red healing for the space of three
days and three nights, to the end that he might then vent
<a name="footnotetag3_278" id="footnotetag3_278" href="#footnote3_278"><sup>3</sup></a>his anger and<a href="#footnote3_278"><sup>3</sup></a> strength on his enemies. For what he
said was that there would not be found after him any one
he would rather have vindicate or avenge him than himself.

Thereupon Fingin the prophetic leech asked of Cuchulain
a vat of marrow wherewith to heal and to cure Cethern
son of Fintan. Cuchulain proceeded to the camp and entrenchment
of the men of Erin, and whatsoever he found
of herds and flocks and droves there he took away with him.
And he made a marrow-mash of their flesh and their bones
and their skins; and Cethern son of Fintan was placed
in the marrow-bath till the end of three days and three
nights. And his flesh began to drink in the marrow-bath
about him and the marrow-bath entered in within his
stabs and his cuts, his sores and his many wounds. Thereafter
he arose from the marrow-bath at the end of three
days and three nights, <a name="footnotetag1_279" id="footnotetag1_279" href="#footnote1_279"><sup>1</sup></a>and he slept a day and a night after
taking in the marrow.<a href="#footnote1_279"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_279" id="footnotetag2_279" href="#footnote2_279"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;I have no ribs more,&quot; said
Cethern; &quot;put the ribs of the chariot-box into me.&quot; &quot;Thou
shalt have it,&quot; Cuchulain made answer.<a href="#footnote2_279"><sup>2</sup></a> It was thus Cethern
arose, with a slab of the chariot pressed to his belly so that
his entrails and bowels would not drop out of him. <a name="footnotetag3_279" id="footnotetag3_279" href="#footnote3_279"><sup>3</sup></a>&quot;Had
I my own weapons,&quot; said Cethern, &quot;the story of what I
would do would live forever!&quot;<a href="#footnote3_279"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>That was the time when his wife came from the north,
from D&ucirc;n da Benn ('Fort of the two Gables'), and she
brought his sword with her, even Finna daughter of Eocho.
<a name="footnotetag4_279" id="footnotetag4_279" href="#footnote4_279"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;What seest thou?&quot; asked Cethern.<a href="#footnote4_279"><sup>4</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag5_279" id="footnotetag5_279" href="#footnote5_279"><sup>5</sup></a>&quot;Meseems,&quot;

to the encampment,<a href="#footnote2_280"><sup>2</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_280" id="footnotetag3_280" href="#footnote3_280"><sup>3</sup></a>and he, the leech that had alone

<p>&quot;Hark, ye men of Erin,&quot; shouted the leech; &quot;Cethern
son of Fintan comes to attack you, now that he has
been healed and cured by Fingin the prophetic leech, and
take ye heed of him!&quot; Thereat the men of Erin <a name="footnotetag4_280" id="footnotetag4_280" href="#footnote4_280"><sup>4</sup></a>in fear<a href="#footnote4_280"><sup>4</sup></a>

on the pillar-stone in Crich Ross, that it might be thereon
that Cethern son of Fintan should first give vent to his

the place where he<a href="#footnote7_280"><sup>7</sup></a> saw those things, namely Ailill's dress
and his golden shawl around the standing-stone in Crich
Ross, and he, being unaware and weetless, conceived it to
be Ailill himself that was in it. And he made a rush at it
like a blast of wind and drave the sword through the stone
pillar till it went up to its pommel, <a name="footnotetag8_280" id="footnotetag8_280" href="#footnote8_280"><sup>8</sup></a>so that his fist went
through it after the sword.<a href="#footnote8_280"><sup>8</sup></a> &quot;Deceit is here,&quot; cried
Cethern son of Fintan, &quot;and on me have ye worked this

about him and the golden shawl, I will not stay my hand from
them, slaughtering and destroying withal!&quot;</p>

<p>Man&egrave; Andoe son of Ailill and Medb heard that, and he
put <a name="footnotetag10_280" id="footnotetag10_280" href="#footnote10_280"><sup>10</sup></a>his father's<a href="#footnote10_280"><sup>10</sup></a> royal raiment about him and the golden

up in his chariot before him<a href="#footnote11_280"><sup>11</sup></a> and dashed off through the
midst of the men of Erin. Cethern son of Fintan pursued
him closely and hurled his shield the length of a cast at him,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_281" name="Page_281" title="281">281</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 4454.</span>
so that the chiselled rim of the shield clave him<a name="footnotetaga_281" id="footnotetaga_281" href="#footnotea_281"><sup>a</sup></a> to the

<h2>XXIII. HERE FOLLOWETH THE TOOTH-FIGHT OF FINTAN</h2>


<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 4502.</span>
Fintan, himself the son of Niall Niamglonnach ('of the
brilliant Exploits') from D&ucirc;n da Benn <a name="footnotetag1_283" id="footnotetag1_283" href="#footnote1_283"><sup>1</sup></a>in the north,<a href="#footnote1_283"><sup>1</sup></a> was
father of Cethern son of Fintan. And he came to save the
honour of Ulster and to avenge his son upon the hosts.
Thrice fifty <a name="footnotetag2_283" id="footnotetag2_283" href="#footnote2_283"><sup>2</sup></a>with many pointed weapons<a href="#footnote2_283"><sup>2</sup></a> was his number.
And thus it was they came, and two spear-heads on each
shaft with them, a spear-head on the top and a spear-head
at the butt, so that it made no difference whether they
wounded the hosts with the points or with the butts. They
offered three<a name="footnotetaga_283" id="footnotetaga_283" href="#footnotea_283"><sup>a</sup></a> battles to the hosts. And thrice their own
number fell at their hands, and there fell also the people <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 91b.</span>
of Fintan son of Niall, all excepting Fintan's son Crimthann
alone,<a name="footnotetag3_283" id="footnotetag3_283" href="#footnote3_283"><sup>3</sup></a> so that there did not escape any of his people excepting
himself and his son.<a href="#footnote3_283"><sup>3</sup></a> This one was saved under a
canopy of shields by Ailill and Medb. <a name="footnotetag4_283" id="footnotetag4_283" href="#footnote4_283"><sup>4</sup></a>And the son was
separated from him, his father Fintan, and was saved
by Ailill out of fear of Fintan and in order that Fintan might
not wreak his fury on them till he should come with Conchobar
to the battle.<a href="#footnote4_283"><sup>4</sup></a> Then said the men of Erin, it would
be no disgrace for Fintan son of Niall to withdraw from
the camp and quarters, and that they would give up Crimthann
son of Fintan to him, and then the hosts would
fall back a day's march to the north again; and that he
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_284" name="Page_284" title="284">284</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 4515.</span>
should cease from his deeds of arms against the hosts till
he would come to encounter them on the day of the great
battle at the place where the four grand provinces of Erin
would clash at Garech and Ilgarech in the battle of the
Cattle-reaving of Cualnge, as was foretold by the druids of
the men of Erin. Fintan son of Niall consented to that,
and they gave over his son to him. <a name="footnotetag1_284" id="footnotetag1_284" href="#footnote1_284"><sup>1</sup></a>He made friendship
with them then when his son had been restored to him.<a href="#footnote1_284"><sup>1</sup></a>
He withdrew from the camp and station, and the hosts
marched a day's journey back to the north again, to stop
and cease their advance. <a name="footnotetag2_284" id="footnotetag2_284" href="#footnote2_284"><sup>2</sup></a>Thereafter Fintan went to his
own land.<a href="#footnote2_284"><sup>2</sup></a> In this manner they found each man of the
people of Fintan son of Niall and each man of the men of
Erin, with the lips and the nose <a name="footnotetag3_284" id="footnotetag3_284" href="#footnote3_284"><sup>3</sup></a>and the ear<a href="#footnote3_284"><sup>3</sup></a> of each of
them in the teeth and tusks of the other <a name="footnotetag4_284" id="footnotetag4_284" href="#footnote4_284"><sup>4</sup></a>after they had
used up their arms.<a href="#footnote4_284"><sup>4</sup></a> The men of Erin gave thought to that:
&quot;This is a tooth-fight for us,&quot; said they; &quot;the tooth-fight
of Fintan's people and of Fintan himself.&quot; So this is the
'Tooth-fight' of Fintan.</p>

was his number. It was thus they came, and two spear-heads
on each shaft with them, a spear-head on the top and a
spear-head at the butt, so that it made no difference whether
they wounded the hosts with the points or with the butts.
They offered three attacks upon the hosts. Three times
their own number fell at their hands and there fell twelve
men of the people of Menn, <a name="footnotetag5_285" id="footnotetag5_285" href="#footnote5_285"><sup>5</sup></a>so that there remained alive
of them but Menn alone.<a href="#footnote5_285"><sup>5</sup></a> But Menn himself was <a name="footnotetag6_285" id="footnotetag6_285" href="#footnote6_285"><sup>6</sup></a>sorely<a href="#footnote6_285"><sup>6</sup></a>
wounded in the strait, so that blood ran crimson on him
<a name="footnotetag7_285" id="footnotetag7_285" href="#footnote7_285"><sup>7</sup></a>and his followers too were crimsoned.<a href="#footnote7_285"><sup>7</sup></a> Then said the
men of Erin: &quot;Red is this shame,&quot; said they, &quot;for Menn
son of Salcholga, that his people, <a name="footnotetag8_285" id="footnotetag8_285" href="#footnote8_285"><sup>8</sup></a>twelve men,<a href="#footnote8_285"><sup>8</sup></a> should be
slain and destroyed and he himself wounded till blood ran
crimson red upon him.&quot; Hence here is the 'Reddening

Kine of Cualnge.<a href="#footnote9_285"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Then said the men of Erin, it would be no dishonour for
Menn son of Salcholga to leave the camp and quarters,
and that the hosts would go a day's journey back to the

on the hosts till Conchobar arose out of his 'Pains' and
battle would be offered them at Garech and Ilgarech <a name="footnotetag1_286" id="footnotetag1_286" href="#footnote1_286"><sup>1</sup></a>on
the day of the great battle when the men of Erin and of

of the Cualnge Cow-spoil,<a href="#footnote1_286"><sup>1</sup></a> as the druids and soothsayers
and the knowers of the men of Erin had foretold it.</p>

<p>Menn son of Salcholga agreed to that, to leave the camp
and halting-place. And the hosts fell back a day's march
for to rest and wait, <a name="footnotetag2_286" id="footnotetag2_286" href="#footnote2_286"><sup>2</sup></a>and Menn went his way to his own

Thrice fifty was their number. They offered three battles
to the hosts. Thrice their number fell at their hands, and
the charioteers themselves fell on the field whereon they
stood. Hence this here is the 'Accoutrement of the

to speak to her mother thereof, even to Medb. <a name="footnotetag1_289" id="footnotetag1_289" href="#footnote1_289"><sup>1</sup></a>Now it
happened that Finnabair loved Rochad. It is he was the

us on the day of the great battle when four of the
grand provinces of Erin will meet at Garech and Ilgarech
in the battle of the Foray of Cualnge.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag8_289" id="footnotetag8_289" href="#footnote8_289"><sup>8</sup></a>This then is done. Rochad sets forth to meet the horseman.
&quot;I am come,&quot; says the horseman, &quot;from Finnabair
to meet thee that thou come to speak with the maiden.&quot;
Thereupon Rochad goes alone to converse with her. The
army surrounds him on all sides; he is seized and hands
are laid on him; his followers are routed and driven in
flight. Afterwards he is set free and bound over not to
oppose Ailill's host till the time he will come with all the
warriors of Ulster. Also they promise to give Finnabair
to him.<a href="#footnote8_289"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Rochad son of Fathemon accepted the offer <a name="footnotetag9_289" id="footnotetag9_289" href="#footnote9_289"><sup>9</sup></a>and thereupon
he left them<a href="#footnote9_289"><sup>9</sup></a> and that night the damsel slept with
him.</p>

<p>An Under-king of Munster that was in the camp heard
the tale. He went to his people to speak of it. &quot;Yonder
maiden was plighted to me <a name="footnotetag10_289" id="footnotetag10_289" href="#footnote10_289"><sup>10</sup></a>on fifteen hostages<a href="#footnote10_289"><sup>10</sup></a> once long

it was for this they were come. <a name="footnotetag1_290" id="footnotetag1_290" href="#footnote1_290"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;Yonder maiden was
pledged to each of us in the bargain as our sole wife, to the
end that we should take part in this warfare.&quot; They all
declared that that was the price and condition on which
they had come on the hosting.<a href="#footnote1_290"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;Why,&quot; said they, <a name="footnotetag2_290" id="footnotetag2_290" href="#footnote2_290"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;what

army at Imlech in Glendamrach ('Kettle-glen's navel)?&quot;</p>

<p>This was the course they resolved upon. And with their
seven divisions of thirty hundreds they arose, <a name="footnotetag5_290" id="footnotetag5_290" href="#footnote5_290"><sup>5</sup></a>each man
of them to attack the Man&egrave;. When Ailill heard that,<a href="#footnote5_290"><sup>5</sup></a> he
arose <a name="footnotetag6_290" id="footnotetag6_290" href="#footnote6_290"><sup>6</sup></a>with a start with ready shield<a href="#footnote6_290"><sup>6</sup></a> against them and
thirty hundred <a name="footnotetag7_290" id="footnotetag7_290" href="#footnote7_290"><sup>7</sup></a>after them.<a href="#footnote7_290"><sup>7</sup></a> Medb arose with her thirty
hundred. The sons of Maga with theirs and the Leinstermen
and the Munstermen and the people of Tara.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag8_290" id="footnotetag8_290" href="#footnote8_290"><sup>8</sup></a>Then arose Fergus with his thirty hundred to intervene
between them, and that was a hand for that mighty work.<a href="#footnote8_290"><sup>8</sup></a>
And a mediation was made between them so that each
of them sat down near the other and hard by his arms.
Howbeit before the intervention took place, eight hundred<a name="footnotetagb_290" id="footnotetagb_290" href="#footnoteb_290"><sup>b</sup></a>
very valiant warriors of them had fallen <a name="footnotetag9_290" id="footnotetag9_290" href="#footnote9_290"><sup>9</sup></a>in the slaughter
of Glenn Domain ('Deep Glen').<a href="#footnote9_290"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Finnabair, daughter of Ailill and Medb, had tidings that
so great a number of the men of Erin had fallen for her sake
and on account of her. And her heart broke in her breast
even as a nut, through shame and disgrace, so that Finnabair
Sleb&egrave; ('Finnabair of the Mount') is the name of the place
where she fell, <a name="footnotetag10_290" id="footnotetag10_290" href="#footnote10_290"><sup>10</sup></a>died and was buried.<a href="#footnote10_290"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_291" name="Page_291" title="291">291</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 4585.</span>
Then said the men of Erin, &quot;White is this battle,&quot; said
they, &quot;for Rochad son of Fathemon, in that eight hundred
exceeding brave warriors fell for his sake and on his account,
and he himself goes<a name="footnotetag1_291" id="footnotetag1_291" href="#footnote1_291"><sup>1</sup></a> safe and whole to his country and
land<a href="#footnote1_291"><sup>1</sup></a> without blood-shedding or reddening on him.&quot;
Hence this is the 'White-fight' of Rochad.</p>

<a name="footnotetag1_292" id="footnotetag1_292" href="#footnote1_292"><sup>1</sup></a>Then came to them<a href="#footnote1_292"><sup>1</sup></a> Iliach son of Cass son of Bacc son

Buadach ('the Victorious') in Rath Imbil in the north.<a href="#footnote2_292"><sup>2</sup></a>
It was told him that the four grand provinces of Erin even

women and their cows and their children, their flocks, their
herds and their cattle, their oxen and their kine and their
droves, their steeds and their horses.<a href="#footnote4_292"><sup>4</sup></a> He then conceived
a plan <a name="footnotetag5_292" id="footnotetag5_292" href="#footnote5_292"><sup>5</sup></a>in his mind<a href="#footnote5_292"><sup>5</sup></a> and he made perfect his plan privily

over them, and thus avenge the honour of Ulster. And I
care not though I should fall myself there thereafter.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 92b.</span> And this is the counsel he followed. His two

<p>He assailed the men of Erin with his weapons till he had
made an end of them. And when weapons failed he
assailed the men of Erin with cobbles and boulders and
huge clumps <a name="footnotetag3_294" id="footnotetag3_294" href="#footnote3_294"><sup>3</sup></a>of earth<a href="#footnote3_294"><sup>3</sup></a> till he had used them up. And
when these weapons failed him he spent his rage on the
man <a name="footnotetag4_294" id="footnotetag4_294" href="#footnote4_294"><sup>4</sup></a>that was nearest him<a href="#footnote4_294"><sup>4</sup></a> of the men of Erin, and bruised
him grievously between his fore-arms <a name="footnotetag5_294" id="footnotetag5_294" href="#footnote5_294"><sup>5</sup></a>and his sides<a href="#footnote5_294"><sup>5</sup></a> and
the palms of his hands, till he made a marrow-mass of
him, of flesh and bones and sinews and skin. Hence in
memory thereof, these two masses of marrow still live on
side by side, the marrow-mass that Cuchulain made of the
bones of the Ulstermen's cattle for the healing of Cethern
son of Fintan,<a name="footnotetaga_294" id="footnotetaga_294" href="#footnotea_294"><sup>a</sup></a> and the marrow-mass that Iliach made of the
bones of the men of Erin. Wherefore this was one of the
three innumerable things of the T&aacute;in, the number of them
that fell at the hands of Iliach. So that this is the 'Clump-fight'
of Iliach. It is for this reason it is called the
'Clump-fight' of Iliach, because with cobbles and boulders
and massy clumps he made his fight.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag6_294" id="footnotetag6_294" href="#footnote6_294"><sup>6</sup></a>Thereafter<a href="#footnote6_294"><sup>6</sup></a> Doch&egrave; son of Maga met him. &quot;Is not
this Iliach?&quot; asked Doch&egrave; son of Maga. &quot;It is truly I,&quot;
Iliach gave answer; &quot;and come to me now and cut off my
head and let my sword remain with thee for thy friend,

<p>Doch&egrave; came near him and gave him a blow with the
sword so that he severed his head, <a name="footnotetag8_294" id="footnotetag8_294" href="#footnote8_294"><sup>8</sup></a>and he took with him
the head and the spoils vauntingly to where were Ailill

And he put his left<a name="footnotetaga_295" id="footnotetaga_295" href="#footnotea_295"><sup>a</sup></a> elbow under him in Taltiu. And his

<h2><span class="sc">XXIIIf</span>. THE ADVENTURES OF CUROI SON OF DAR&Egrave; FOLLOW NOW</h2>


<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 4645.</span>
He was told that a single man was checking and stopping
four of the five grand provinces of Erin <a name="footnotetag1_296" id="footnotetag1_296" href="#footnote1_296"><sup>1</sup></a>during the three
months of winter<a href="#footnote1_296"><sup>1</sup></a> from Monday at Summer's end till the
beginning of Spring. And he felt it unworthy of himself
and he deemed it too long that his people were without
him. And <a name="footnotetag2_296" id="footnotetag2_296" href="#footnote2_296"><sup>2</sup></a>it was then<a href="#footnote2_296"><sup>2</sup></a> he set out <a name="footnotetag3_296" id="footnotetag3_296" href="#footnote3_296"><sup>3</sup></a>to the host<a href="#footnote3_296"><sup>3</sup></a> to fight
and contend with Cuchulain. And when he was come to
the place where Cuchulain was, he saw Cuchulain there
moaning, full of wounds and pierced through with holes,
and he felt it would not be honourable nor fair to fight and
contend with him after the combat with Ferdiad. <a name="footnotetag4_296" id="footnotetag4_296" href="#footnote4_296"><sup>4</sup></a>Because
it would be said it was not that Cuchulain died of the sores
<sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 93a.</span> and wounds which he would give him so much as of the
wounds which Ferdiad had inflicted on him in the conflict
before.<a href="#footnote4_296"><sup>4</sup></a> Be that as it might, Cuchulain offered to engage
with him in battle and combat.</p>

<p>Thereupon Curoi set forth for to seek the men of Erin
and, when he was near at hand, he espied Amargin there
and his left elbow under him to the west of Taltiu. Curoi
reached the men of Erin from the north. His people
equipped him with rocks and boulders and great clumps,
and he began to hurl them right over against Amargin, so
that Badb's battle-stones collided in the clouds and in the
air high above them, and every rock of them was shivered
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_297" name="Page_297" title="297">297</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 4662.</span>
into an hundred stones. &quot;By the truth of thy valour, O
Curoi,&quot; cried Medb, &quot;desist from thy throwing, for no real
succour nor help comes to us therefrom, but ill is the succour
<a name="footnotetag1_297" id="footnotetag1_297" href="#footnote1_297"><sup>1</sup></a>and help<a href="#footnote1_297"><sup>1</sup></a> that thence come to us,&quot; &quot;I pledge my
word,&quot; cried Curoi, &quot;I will not cease till the very day of
doom and of life, till first Amargin cease!&quot; &quot;I will cease,&quot;
said Amargin; &quot;and do thou engage that thou wilt no
more come to succour or give aid to the men of Erin.&quot;
Curoi consented to that and went his way to return to his
land and people.</p>

<p>About this time <a name="footnotetag2_297" id="footnotetag2_297" href="#footnote2_297"><sup>2</sup></a>the hosts<a href="#footnote2_297"><sup>2</sup></a> went past Taltiu westwards.
&quot;It is not this was enjoined upon me,&quot; quoth
Amargin: &quot;never again to cast at the hosts <a name="footnotetag3_297" id="footnotetag3_297" href="#footnote3_297"><sup>3</sup></a>but rather
that I should part from them.&quot;<a href="#footnote3_297"><sup>3</sup></a> And he went to the west
of them and he turned them before him north-eastwards
past Taltiu. And he began to pelt them for a long while
and time <a name="footnotetag4_297" id="footnotetag4_297" href="#footnote4_297"><sup>4</sup></a>so that he slaughtered more of them than can
be numbered.<a href="#footnote4_297"><sup>4</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag5_297" id="footnotetag5_297" href="#footnote5_297"><sup>5</sup></a>This is one of the three incalculable
things on the T&aacute;in, the number of those he slew. And his
son Conall Cernach ('the Victorious') remained with him
providing him with stones and spears.<a href="#footnote5_297"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Then it was also that the men of Erin said it would be
no disgrace for Amargin to leave the camp and quarters,
and that the hosts would retire a day's march back to the
north again, there to stop and stay, and for him to quit
his feats of arms upon the hosts until such time as he would
meet them on the day of the great battle when the four
grand provinces of Erin would encounter at Garech and
Ilgarech in the battle of the Raid for the Kine of Cualnge.
Amargin accepted that offer, and the hosts proceeded a
day's march back to the northwards again. Wherefore
the 'Deer-stalking' of Amargin in Taltiu <a name="footnotetag6_297" id="footnotetag6_297" href="#footnote6_297"><sup>6</sup></a>is the name of

<h2>XXIV. THE REPEATED WARNING OF SUALTAIM</h2>


<p><a name="footnotetag1_298" id="footnotetag1_298" href="#footnote1_298"><sup>1</sup></a>Now while the deeds we have told here were being done,<a href="#footnote1_298"><sup>1</sup></a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 4685.</span> Sualtaim ('Goodly fosterer') son of Becaltach ('of Small
belongings') son of Moraltach ('of Great belongings'), the
same the father of Cuchulain macSualtaim, <a name="footnotetag2_298" id="footnotetag2_298" href="#footnote2_298"><sup>2</sup></a>of Sualtaim's
Rath in the plain of Murthemne,<a href="#footnote2_298"><sup>2</sup></a> was told of the distress
and <a name="footnotetag3_298" id="footnotetag3_298" href="#footnote3_298"><sup>3</sup></a>sore wounding<a href="#footnote3_298"><sup>3</sup></a> of his son contending in unequal
combat on the Cualnge Cattle-spoil, even against Calatin
Dana ('the Bold') with his seven and twenty<a name="footnotetaga_298" id="footnotetaga_298" href="#footnotea_298"><sup>a</sup></a> sons, and
against Glass son of Delga, his grandson, <a name="footnotetag4_298" id="footnotetag4_298" href="#footnote4_298"><sup>4</sup></a>and at the last
against Ferdiad son of Daman.<a href="#footnote4_298"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag5_298" id="footnotetag5_298" href="#footnote5_298"><sup>5</sup></a>It is then that Sualtaim said<a href="#footnote5_298"><sup>5</sup></a>: &quot;Whate'er it be,
<a name="footnotetag6_298" id="footnotetag6_298" href="#footnote6_298"><sup>6</sup></a>this that I hear<a href="#footnote6_298"><sup>6</sup></a> from afar,&quot; quoth Sualtaim, &quot;it is the
sky that bursts or the sea that ebbs or the earth that
quakes, or is it the distress of my son overmatched in the
strife on the Driving of the Kine of Cualnge?&quot;</p>

<p>In that, indeed, Sualtaim spoke true. And he went to
learn all after a while, without hastening on his way. And
when Sualtaim was come to where <a name="footnotetag7_298" id="footnotetag7_298" href="#footnote7_298"><sup>7</sup></a>his son<a href="#footnote7_298"><sup>7</sup></a> Cuchulain
was <a name="footnotetag8_298" id="footnotetag8_298" href="#footnote8_298"><sup>8</sup></a>and found him covered with wounds and bloody
gashes and many stabs,<a href="#footnote8_298"><sup>8</sup></a> Sualtaim began to moan and lament
<a name="footnotetag9_298" id="footnotetag9_298" href="#footnote9_298"><sup>9</sup></a>for Cuchulain.<a href="#footnote9_298"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_299" name="Page_299" title="299">299</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 4695.</span>
Forsooth Cuchulain deemed it neither an honour nor
glory that Sualtaim should bemoan and lament him, for
Cuchulain knew that, wounded and injured though he was,
Sualtaim would not be <a name="footnotetag1_299" id="footnotetag1_299" href="#footnote1_299"><sup>1</sup></a>the man<a href="#footnote1_299"><sup>1</sup></a> to avenge his wrong.
For such was Sualtaim: He was no mean warrior and he
was no mighty warrior, but only a good, worthy man was
he. &quot;Come, my father Sualtaim,&quot; said Cuchulain;
<a name="footnotetag2_299" id="footnotetag2_299" href="#footnote2_299"><sup>2</sup></a>&quot;cease thy sighing and mourning for me, and<a href="#footnote2_299"><sup>2</sup></a> do thou
go to Emain <a name="footnotetag3_299" id="footnotetag3_299" href="#footnote3_299"><sup>3</sup></a>Macha<a href="#footnote3_299"><sup>3</sup></a> to the men of Ulster and tell them to
come now to have a care for their droves, for no longer am
I able to protect them in the gaps and passes of the land
of Conalle Murthemni. All alone am I against four of the
five grand provinces of Erin from Monday at Summer's
end till the beginning of Spring, every day slaying a man
on a ford and a hundred warriors every night. Fair fight
is not granted me nor single combat, and no <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 93b.</span> one comes to
aid me nor to succour. <a name="footnotetag4_299" id="footnotetag4_299" href="#footnote4_299"><sup>4</sup></a>And such is the measure of my
wounds and my sores that I cannot bear my garments or
my clothing to touch my skin, so that<a href="#footnote4_299"><sup>4</sup></a> spancel-hoops hold
my cloak over me. Dry tufts of grass are stuffed in my
wounds. <a name="footnotetag5_299" id="footnotetag5_299" href="#footnote5_299"><sup>5</sup></a>There is not the space of a needle's point from
my crown to my sole without wound or sore, and<a href="#footnote5_299"><sup>5</sup></a> there
is not a single hair <a name="footnotetag6_299" id="footnotetag6_299" href="#footnote6_299"><sup>6</sup></a>on my body<a href="#footnote6_299"><sup>6</sup></a> from my crown to my
sole whereon the point of a needle could stand, without a
drop of deep-red blood on the top of each hair, save the
left hand alone which is holding my shield, and even there
thrice fifty bloody wounds are upon it. <a name="footnotetag7_299" id="footnotetag7_299" href="#footnote7_299"><sup>7</sup></a>And let them
straightway give battle to the warriors,<a href="#footnote7_299"><sup>7</sup></a> and unless they
avenge this anon, they will never avenge it till the very
day of doom and of life!&quot;</p>

<p>Sualtaim set out on Liath ('the Roan') of Macha as his
only horse, with warning to the men of Ulster. And when
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_300" name="Page_300" title="300">300</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 4716.</span>
he was come alongside of Emain, he shouted these words
there: &quot;Men are slain, women stolen, cattle lifted, ye
men of Ulster!&quot; cried Sualtaim.</p>

<p>He had not <a name="footnotetag1_300" id="footnotetag1_300" href="#footnote1_300"><sup>1</sup></a>the answer<a href="#footnote1_300"><sup>1</sup></a> that served him from the
Ulstermen, and forasmuch as he had it not he went on
further to the rampart of Emain. And he cried out the
same words there: &quot;Men are slain, women stolen, cattle
lifted, ye men of Ulster!&quot; cried Sualtaim.</p>

<p>And <a name="footnotetag2_300" id="footnotetag2_300" href="#footnote2_300"><sup>2</sup></a>a second time<a href="#footnote2_300"><sup>2</sup></a> he had not the response that served
him from the men of Ulster. Thus stood it among the
Ulstermen: It was geis for the Ulstermen to speak before
their king, geis for the king to speak before his <a name="footnotetag3_300" id="footnotetag3_300" href="#footnote3_300"><sup>3</sup></a>three<a href="#footnote3_300"><sup>3</sup></a>
druids. Thereafter Sualtaim drove on to the 'Flag-stone of
the hostages' in Emain Macha. He shouted the same
words there: &quot;Men are slain, women stolen, cows carried
off!&quot; &quot;But who has slain them, and who has stolen them,
and who has carried them off?&quot; asked Cathba the druid.
&quot;Ailill and Medb have, <a name="footnotetag4_300" id="footnotetag4_300" href="#footnote4_300"><sup>4</sup></a>with the cunning of Fergus mac
Roig,<a href="#footnote4_300"><sup>4</sup></a> overwhelmed you. <a name="footnotetag5_300" id="footnotetag5_300" href="#footnote5_300"><sup>5</sup></a>Your people have been harassed
as far as D&ucirc;n Sobairche,&quot;<a href="#footnote5_300"><sup>5</sup></a> said Sualtaim. &quot;Your
wives and your sons and your children, your steeds and
your stock of horses, your herds and your flocks and your
droves of cattle have been carried away. Cuchulain all
alone is checking and staying the hosts of the four great
provinces of Erin at the gaps and passes of the land of
Conalle Murthemni. Fair fight is refused him, nor is he
granted single combat, nor comes any one to succour or
aid him. <a name="footnotetag6_300" id="footnotetag6_300" href="#footnote6_300"><sup>6</sup></a>Cuchulain has not suffered them to enter the
plain of Murthemne or into the land of Ross. Three winter
months is he there.<a href="#footnote6_300"><sup>6</sup></a> The youth is wounded, his limbs
are out of joint. Spancel-hoops hold his cloak over him.
There is not a hair from his crown to his sole whereon the
point of a needle could stand, without a drop of deep-red
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_301" name="Page_301" title="301">301</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 4737.</span>
blood on the top of each hair, except his left hand alone
which is holding his shield, and even there thrice fifty
bloody wounds are upon it. And unless ye avenge this
betimes, ye will never avenge it till the end of time and
of life.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 94a.</span> &quot;Fitter is death and doom and destruction for the
man that so incites the king!&quot; quoth Cathba the druid.
&quot;In good sooth, it is true!&quot; <a name="footnotetag1_301" id="footnotetag1_301" href="#footnote1_301"><sup>1</sup></a>said the Ulstermen<a href="#footnote1_301"><sup>1</sup></a> all
together.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag2_301" id="footnotetag2_301" href="#footnote2_301"><sup>2</sup></a>Thereupon<a href="#footnote2_301"><sup>2</sup></a> Sualtaim went his way <a name="footnotetag3_301" id="footnotetag3_301" href="#footnote3_301"><sup>3</sup></a>from them,<a href="#footnote3_301"><sup>3</sup></a> indignant
and angry because from the men of Ulster he had
not had the answer that served him. Then reared Liath
('the Roan') of Macha under Sualtaim and dashed on to the
ramparts of Emain. Thereat <a name="footnotetag4_301" id="footnotetag4_301" href="#footnote4_301"><sup>4</sup></a>Sualtaim fell under his own
shield, so that<a href="#footnote4_301"><sup>4</sup></a> his own shield turned on Sualtaim and the
<a name="footnotetag5_301" id="footnotetag5_301" href="#footnote5_301"><sup>5</sup></a>scalloped<a href="#footnote5_301"><sup>5</sup></a> edge of the shield severed Sualtaim's head,
<a name="footnotetag6_301" id="footnotetag6_301" href="#footnote6_301"><sup>6</sup></a>though others say he was asleep on the stone, and that
he fell thence onto his shield on awaking.<a href="#footnote6_301"><sup>6</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag7_301" id="footnotetag7_301" href="#footnote7_301"><sup>7</sup></a>Hence this
is the 'Tragical Death of Sualtaim.'<a href="#footnote7_301"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>The horse himself turned back again to Emain, and the
shield on the horse and the head on the shield. And Sualtaim's
head uttered the same words: &quot;Men are slain,
women stolen, cattle lifted, ye men of Ulster!&quot; spake the
head of Sualtaim.</p>

<p>&quot;Some deal too great is that cry,&quot; quoth Conchobar;
&quot;for yet is the sky above us, the earth underneath and
the sea round about us. And unless the heavens shall
fall with their showers of stars on the man-like<a name="footnotetaga_301" id="footnotetaga_301" href="#footnotea_301"><sup>a</sup></a> face of
the world, or unless the ground burst open in quakes <a name="footnotetag8_301" id="footnotetag8_301" href="#footnote8_301"><sup>8</sup></a>beneath
our feet,<a href="#footnote8_301"><sup>8</sup></a> or unless the furrowed, blue-bordered
ocean break o'er the tufted brow of the earth, will I restore

<span class="sidenoteL">W. 4756.</span>
to her byre and her stall, to her abode and her dwelling-place,
each and every cow and woman of them with victory
of battle and contest and combat!&quot;</p>

<p>Thereupon a runner of his body-guard was summoned
to Conchobar, Findchad Ferbenduma ('he of the copper
Horn') to wit, son of Fraech Lethan ('the Broad'), and Conchobar
bade him go assemble and muster the men of Ulster.
And in like manner, in the drunkenness of sleep and of his
'Pains,' Conchobar enumerated to him their quick and
their dead, and he uttered these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>It was nowise a heavy task for Finnchad to gather this
assembly and muster which Conchobar had enjoined upon
him. For all there were <a name="footnotetag5_304" id="footnotetag5_304" href="#footnote5_304"><sup>5</sup></a>of Ulstermen<a href="#footnote5_304"><sup>5</sup></a> to the east of
Emain and to the west of Emain and to the north of Emain
set out at once for the field of Emain in the service of their
king, and at the word of their lord, and to await the recovery
of Conchobar. Such as were from the south of Emain
<a name="footnotetag6_304" id="footnotetag6_304" href="#footnote6_304"><sup>6</sup></a>waited not for Conchobar, but<a href="#footnote6_304"><sup>6</sup></a> set out directly on the
trail of the host and on the hoof-prints of the T&aacute;in.</p>

<p>The first stage the men of Ulster marched under Conchobar
was <a name="footnotetag7_304" id="footnotetag7_304" href="#footnote7_304"><sup>7</sup></a>from Emain<a href="#footnote7_304"><sup>7</sup></a> to the green in Iraird Cuillinn
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_305" name="Page_305" title="305">305</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 4932.</span>
that night. &quot;Why now delay we, ye men?&quot; Conchobar
asked. &quot;We await thy sons,&quot; they answered; &quot;Fiacha
and Fiachna who have gone <a name="footnotetag1_305" id="footnotetag1_305" href="#footnote1_305"><sup>1</sup></a>with a division<a href="#footnote1_305"><sup>1</sup></a> from us
<a name="footnotetag2_305" id="footnotetag2_305" href="#footnote2_305"><sup>2</sup></a>to Tara<a href="#footnote2_305"><sup>2</sup></a> to fetch Erc son of thy daughter Fedlimid
Nocruthach ('Nine-shaped'), son also of Carbre Niafer
<a name="footnotetag3_305" id="footnotetag3_305" href="#footnote3_305"><sup>3</sup></a>king of Tara,<a href="#footnote3_305"><sup>3</sup></a> to the end that he should come with the
number of his muster and his troops, his levy and his forces
to our host at this time. <a name="footnotetag4_305" id="footnotetag4_305" href="#footnote4_305"><sup>4</sup></a>Until these two divisions come
to us, no further advance will we make from this place.&quot;<a href="#footnote4_305"><sup>4</sup></a>
&quot;By my word,&quot; exclaimed Conchobar; &quot;I will delay
here no longer for them, lest the men of Erin hear of my
rising from the weakness and 'Pains' wherein I was. For
the men of Erin know not even if I am still alive!&quot;</p>

<p>Thereupon Conchobar and Celtchar proceeded with thirty
hundred spear-bristling chariot-fighters to Ath Irmidi
('the Ford of Spear-points'). And there met them there
eight-score huge men of the body-guard of Ailill and Medb,
with eight-score women <a name="footnotetag5_305" id="footnotetag5_305" href="#footnote5_305"><sup>5</sup></a>of the Ulstermen's women<a href="#footnote5_305"><sup>5</sup></a> as
their spoils. Thus was their portion of the plunder of
Ulster: A woman-captive in the hand of each man of them.
Conchobar and Celtchar struck off their eight-score heads
and released their eight-score captive-women. Ath Irmidi
('the Ford of Spear-points') was the name of the place till
that time; Ath Fen&egrave; is its name ever since. It is for this
it is called Ath Fen&egrave;, because the warriors of the Fen&egrave; from
the east and the warriors of the Fen&egrave; from the west encountered
one another in battle and contest man for man
on the brink of the ford.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag2_309" id="footnotetag2_309" href="#footnote2_309"><sup>2</sup></a>While these things were being done, the Connachtmen
by the counsel of Ailill, Medb, and Fergus, resolved to
send messengers from thence to spy out the men of Ulster,
to make certain if they had taken possession of the plain.<a href="#footnote2_309"><sup>2</sup></a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5011.</span> Said Ailill: &quot;Truly have I succeeded,&quot; said he, &quot;in laying
waste Ulster and the land of the Picts <a name="footnotetag3_309" id="footnotetag3_309" href="#footnote3_309"><sup>3</sup></a>and Cualnge<a href="#footnote3_309"><sup>3</sup></a> from
Monday at Summer's end till Spring's beginning. We have
taken their women and their sons and their children, their
steeds and their troops of horses, their herds and their flocks
and their droves. We have laid level their hills after them,
so that they have become lowlands and are all one height.
For this cause, will I await them no longer here, but let
them offer me battle on Mag Ai, if so it please them. But,
say here what we will, some one shall go forth <a name="footnotetag4_309" id="footnotetag4_309" href="#footnote4_309"><sup>4</sup></a>from us<a href="#footnote4_309"><sup>4</sup></a>
to watch the great, wide plain of Meath, to know if the
men of Ulster come hither. And, should the men of Ulster
come hither, I will in no wise be the first to retreat <a name="footnotetag5_309" id="footnotetag5_309" href="#footnote5_309"><sup>5</sup></a>till
battle be given them,<a href="#footnote5_309"><sup>5</sup></a> for it was never the wont of a good
king to retreat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who should fitly go thither?&quot; asked all. &quot;Who
but macRoth our chief runner yonder,&quot; <a name="footnotetag6_309" id="footnotetag6_309" href="#footnote6_309"><sup>6</sup></a>answered another
group of them.<a href="#footnote6_309"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_310" name="Page_310" title="310">310</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 5023.</span>
MacRoth went his way to survey the great wide-spreading
plain of Meath. Not long was macRoth there when he
heard something: A rush and a crash and a clatter and a
clash. Not slight the thing he judged it to be, but as
though it was the firmament itself that fell on the man-like
face of the world, or as though it was the furrowed,
blue-bordered ocean that broke o'er the tufted brow of the
earth, or as though the ground had gone asunder in quakes,
or as though the forest fell, each of the trees in the crotches
and forks and branches of the other. But why give further
accounts! The wood's wild beasts were hunted out on the
plain, so that beneath them the grassy forelocks of the plain
of Meath were not to be seen.</p>

<p>MacRoth hastened to tell this tale at the place where
were Ailill and Medb and Fergus and the nobles of the men
of Erin. MacRoth related the whole matter to them.</p>

<p>&quot;What was that there, O Fergus?&quot; asked Ailill; <a name="footnotetag1_310" id="footnotetag1_310" href="#footnote1_310"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;to
what likenest thou it?&quot;<a href="#footnote1_310"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;Not hard <a name="footnotetag2_310" id="footnotetag2_310" href="#footnote2_310"><sup>2</sup></a>for me to say
what it resembled.<a href="#footnote2_310"><sup>2</sup></a> It was the rush and tramp and clatter
that he heard,&quot; said Fergus, &quot;the din and thunder, the
tumult and turmoil <a name="footnotetag3_310" id="footnotetag3_310" href="#footnote3_310"><sup>3</sup></a>of the Ulstermen.<a href="#footnote3_310"><sup>3</sup></a> It was the men
of Ulster <a name="footnotetag4_310" id="footnotetag4_310" href="#footnote4_310"><sup>4</sup></a>arising from their 'Pains,'<a href="#footnote4_310"><sup>4</sup></a> who have come
into the woods, the throng of champions and battle-heroes
cutting down with their swords the woods in the way of their
chariots. This it was that hath put the wild animals to
flight on the plain, so that the grassy forelocks of the field
of Meath are hidden beneath them!&quot;</p>

<p>Another time macRoth surveyed the plain and he saw
something: A heavy, grey mist that filled <a name="footnotetag5_310" id="footnotetag5_310" href="#footnote5_310"><sup>5</sup></a>the glens and
the slopes,<a href="#footnote5_310"><sup>5</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag6_310" id="footnotetag6_310" href="#footnote6_310"><sup>6</sup></a>the upper void and veil,<a href="#footnote6_310"><sup>6</sup></a> the space between
the heavens and earth. It seemed to him that <a name="footnotetag7_310" id="footnotetag7_310" href="#footnote7_310"><sup>7</sup></a>the hills<a href="#footnote7_310"><sup>7</sup></a>
were islands in lakes that he saw rising up out of the sloping
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_311" name="Page_311" title="311">311</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5044.</span>
valleys of mist. It seemed to him they were wide-yawning
caverns that he saw there leading into that mist. It
seemed to him it was all-white, flaxy sheets of linen, or sifted
snow a-falling that he saw there through a rift in the mist.
It seemed to him it was a flight of many, varied, wonderful,
numerous birds <a name="footnotetag1_311" id="footnotetag1_311" href="#footnote1_311"><sup>1</sup></a>that he<a name="footnotetaga_311" id="footnotetaga_311" href="#footnotea_311"><sup>a</sup></a> saw in the same mist,<a href="#footnote1_311"><sup>1</sup></a> or
the constant sparkling of shining stars <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 96a.</span> on a bright, clear
night of hoar-frost, or sparks of red-flaming fire. He heard
something: A rush and a din and a hurtling sound, a noise
and a thunder, a tumult and a turmoil, <a name="footnotetag2_311" id="footnotetag2_311" href="#footnote2_311"><sup>2</sup></a>and a great wind
that all but took the hair from his<a name="footnotetagb_311" id="footnotetagb_311" href="#footnoteb_311"><sup>b</sup></a> head and threw him<a name="footnotetagc_311" id="footnotetagc_311" href="#footnotec_311"><sup>c</sup></a> on
his<a href="#footnoteb_311"><sup>b</sup></a> back, and yet the wind of the day was not great.<a href="#footnote2_311"><sup>2</sup></a> He
hastened on to impart these tidings at the place where were
Ailill and Medb and Fergus and the nobles of the men of
Erin. He reported the matter to them.</p>

<p>&quot;But what was that, O Fergus?&quot; asked Ailill. &quot;Not
hard to say,&quot; Fergus made answer. &quot;This was the great,
grey mist that he saw which filled the space between the
heavens and earth, namely, the streaming breath both
of horses and men, the smoke of the earth and the dust of
the roads as it rose over them with the driving of the wind,
so that it made a heavy, deep-grey misty vapour thereof
in the clouds and the air.</p>

<p>&quot;These were the islands over lakes that he saw there,
and the tops of hills and of heights over the sloping
valleys of mist, even the heads of the champions and battle-heroes
over the chariots and the chariots withal. These
were the wide-yawning caverns that he saw there leading
into that mist, even the mouths and the nostrils of the
horses and champions exhaling and inhaling the sun and
the wind with the speed of the host. These were the all-white,
flax-like cloths that he saw there or the streaming
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_312" name="Page_312" title="312">312</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5066.</span>
snow a-falling, to wit the foam and the froth that the bridles
of the reins flung from the bits of strong, stout steeds with
the stress, <a name="footnotetag1_312" id="footnotetag1_312" href="#footnote1_312"><sup>1</sup></a>with the swiftness and strength and speed<a href="#footnote1_312"><sup>1</sup></a> of
the host.</p>

<p>&quot;These were the flights of many, various, wonderful,
numerous birds that he saw there, even the dust of the ground
and the top of the earth <a name="footnotetag2_312" id="footnotetag2_312" href="#footnote2_312"><sup>2</sup></a>and the sods<a href="#footnote2_312"><sup>2</sup></a> which the horses
flung from their feet and their hoofs and arose <a name="footnotetag3_312" id="footnotetag3_312" href="#footnote3_312"><sup>3</sup></a>over the
heads of the host<a href="#footnote3_312"><sup>3</sup></a> with the driving of the wind.</p>

<p>&quot;This was the rush and the crash and the hurtling sound,
the din and the thunder, the clatter and clash that he heard
there, to wit the shield-shock of shields and the jangle of
javelins and the hard-smiting of swords and the ring of helmets,
the clangour of breast-plates and the rattle of arms and
the fury of feats, the straining of ropes and the whirr of
wheels and the trampling of horses' hoofs and the creaking
of chariots, and the deep voices of heroes and battle-warriors
coming hither towards us.</p>

<p>&quot;This was the constant sparkling of shining stars on a
bright, clear night that he saw there and the sparks of red-flaming
fire, even the bloodthirsty, terrible eyes of the
champions and battle-warriors from under beautiful, well-shaped,
finely-adorned battle-helmets; eyes full of the fury
and rage they brought with them, against the which neither
before nor since has equal combat nor overwhelming force
of battle prevailed, and against which it will never prevail
till the very day of doom and of life!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We make not much of that,&quot; quoth Medb;<a name="footnotetaga_312" id="footnotetaga_312" href="#footnotea_312"><sup>a</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_312" id="footnotetag4_312" href="#footnote4_312"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;we will
await them.<a href="#footnote4_312"><sup>4</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag5_312" id="footnotetag5_312" href="#footnote5_312"><sup>5</sup></a>For<a href="#footnote5_312"><sup>5</sup></a> there are goodly warriors and goodly
fighting-men with us to cope with them.&quot; <a name="footnotetag6_312" id="footnotetag6_312" href="#footnote6_312"><sup>6</sup></a>&quot;Thou shall
have need of them,&quot; answered Fergus.<a href="#footnote6_312"><sup>6</sup></a> &quot;Truly, I
count not on that, O Medb. For I give my word, thou
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_313" name="Page_313" title="313">313</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5087.</span>
shalt find no host in <a name="footnotetag1_313" id="footnotetag1_313" href="#footnote1_313"><sup>1</sup></a>all<a href="#footnote1_313"><sup>1</sup></a> Erin, nor in Alba, <a name="footnotetag2_313" id="footnotetag2_313" href="#footnote2_313"><sup>2</sup></a>nor in the
western part of the world from Greece and Scythia westwards
to the Orkney Islands, the Pillars of Hercules, Bregon's
Tower and the islands of Cadiz<a href="#footnote2_313"><sup>2</sup></a> to cope with the men of
Ulster when once their anger comes on them!&quot;</p>

<p>Then did the four grand provinces of Erin pitch camp
and make lodgment at Clartha for that night. They sent
forth folk to keep watch and guard against Ulster, to the
end that the Ulstermen might not come upon them without
warning, without notice.</p>

<p>Then it was that Conchobar and Celtchar with thirty
hundred bristling chariot-fighters set forth, till they halted
at Slemain Mid&egrave; ('Slane of Meath') <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 96b.</span> in the rear of the
host of Erin. But, though 'halted' we have said, <a name="footnotetag3_313" id="footnotetag3_313" href="#footnote3_313"><sup>3</sup></a>a very
brief halt made they there.<a href="#footnote3_313"><sup>3</sup></a> Not straightway pitched they
camp, but proceeded for a favourable sign to the quarters
of Ailill and Medb, so they might be the first of all to redden
their hands <a name="footnotetag4_313" id="footnotetag4_313" href="#footnote4_313"><sup>4</sup></a>on the men of Erin.<a href="#footnote4_313"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag5_313" id="footnotetag5_313" href="#footnote5_313"><sup>5</sup></a>Then did macRoth go again to view the hosting of the
men of Ulster, so that he reached their encampment at
Slane of Meath.<a href="#footnote5_313"><sup>5</sup></a> It was not long macRoth had been there
when he saw something: An incomparable, immense troop
of horsemen in Slane of Meath coming straight from the
north-east. He hastened forward to where were Ailill
and Medb and Fergus and the chiefs of the men of Erin.
Ailill asked tidings of him on his arrival: &quot;Say, macRoth,&quot;
queried Ailill; &quot;sawest thou aught of the men of
Ulster on the trail of the host this day?&quot; &quot;Truly I know
not,&quot; answered macRoth; &quot;but I saw an incomparable,
immense troop of horsemen in Slane of Meath coming
straight from the north-east.&quot; &quot;But how many numbered
the horse-troop?&quot; asked Ailill. &quot;Not fewer, meseemed,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_314" name="Page_314" title="314">314</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5107.</span>
than thirty hundred fully armed chariot-fighters were they,
even ten hundred and twenty hundred fully armed chariot-fighters,&quot;
macRoth made answer.</p>

<p>&quot;So, O Fergus,&quot; quoth Ailill, <a name="footnotetag1_314" id="footnotetag1_314" href="#footnote1_314"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;those are the warriors
of Ulster with Conchobar!<a href="#footnote1_314"><sup>1</sup></a> How thinkest thou to terrify
us till now with the smoke and dust and the breath of a
mighty host, while all the battle-force thou hast is that we
see yonder!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A little too soon belittlest thou them,&quot; Fergus retorted;
&quot;for mayhap the bands are more numerous than is said they
are.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let us take good, swift counsel on the matter,&quot; said
Medb; &quot;for yon huge, most fierce, most furious man will
attack us we ween, Conchobar, to wit, son of Fachtna
Fathach ('the Giant') son of Ross Ruad ('the Red') son of
Rudraige, himself High King of Ulster and son of the High
King of Erin. Let there be a hollow array of the men of
Erin before Conchobar and a force of thirty hundred ready
to close in from behind, and the men shall be taken and
in no wise wounded; for, no more than is a caitiff's lot is
this whereto they are come!&quot; Wherefore this is the third
most derisive word that was spoken on the Cattle-lifting
of Cualnge, even to take Conchobar <a name="footnotetag2_314" id="footnotetag2_314" href="#footnote2_314"><sup>2</sup></a>and his people<a href="#footnote2_314"><sup>2</sup></a>
prisoners without wounding, and to inflict a caitiff's lot on
the ten hundred and twenty hundred who accompanied the
kings of Ulster.</p>

<p>And Cormac Conlongas son of Conchobar heard that,
and he knew that unless he took vengeance at once upon
Medb for her great boast, he would not avenge it till the very
day of doom and of life.</p>

<p>It was then that Cormac Conlongas son of Conchobar
arose with his troop of thirty hundred to inflict the revenge
of battle and prowess upon Ailill and Medb. Ailill arose
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_315" name="Page_315" title="315">315</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5129.</span>
with his thirty hundred to meet him. Medb arose with
her thirty hundred. The Man&egrave; arose with their thirty
hundred. The sons of Maga arose with their thirty hundred.
The Leinstermen and the Munstermen and the people of
Temair arose and made interposition between them, so that
on both sides each warrior sat down near to the other and
near by his arms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a hollow array of men was made by Medb to
face Conchobar and a <a name="footnotetag1_315" id="footnotetag1_315" href="#footnote1_315"><sup>1</sup></a>warlike<a href="#footnote1_315"><sup>1</sup></a> band of thirty hundred
ready to close in from behind. Conchobar proceeded to
attack the circle of men, <a name="footnotetag2_315" id="footnotetag2_315" href="#footnote2_315"><sup>2</sup></a>to force an opening.<a href="#footnote2_315"><sup>2</sup></a> And he
was far from seeking any particular breach, but he worked
a small gap, broad enough for a man-at-arms, right in front
over against him in the circle of combatants, and effected a
breach of an hundred on his right side, and a breach of an
hundred on his left, and he turned in on them, and mingled
<a name="footnotetag3_315" id="footnotetag3_315" href="#footnote3_315"><sup>3</sup></a>among them<a href="#footnote3_315"><sup>3</sup></a> on their ground, and there fell of them eight
hundred fully brave warriors at his hands. And thereafter
he left them without blood or bleeding from himself and
took his station in Slane of Meath at the head of the men
of Ulster.</p>

<p>&quot;Come, ye men of Erin!&quot; cried Ailill. &quot;Let some one
go hence to scan the wide-stretching plain of Meath, to
know in what guise the men of Ulster come to the height
in Slane of Meath, to bring us an account of their arms
and their gear <a name="footnotetag4_315" id="footnotetag4_315" href="#footnote4_315"><sup>4</sup></a>and their trappings, their kings and their
royal leaders,<a href="#footnote4_315"><sup>4</sup></a> their champions and battle-warriors and gap-breakers
of hundreds and their yeomen, <a name="footnotetag5_315" id="footnotetag5_315" href="#footnote5_315"><sup>5</sup></a>to which to
listen will shorten the time for us.&quot;<a href="#footnote5_315"><sup>5</sup></a> <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 97a.</span> &quot;Who should
go thither?&quot; asked all. &quot;Who but macRoth the chief
runner,&quot; Aililla<a name="footnotetaga_315" id="footnotetaga_315" href="#footnotea_315"><sup>a</sup></a> made answer.</p>

<p>MacRoth went his way till he took his station in Slane
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_316" name="Page_316" title="316">316</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5151.</span>
of Meath, awaiting the men of Ulster. The Ulstermen were
busied in marching to that hill from gloaming of early morn
till sunset hour in the evening. In such manner the earth
was never left naked under them during all that time, every
division of them under its king, and every band under its
leader, and every king and every leader and every lord
with the number of his force and his muster, his gathering
and his levy apart. Howbeit, by sunset hour in the evening
all the men of Ulster had taken position on that height in
Slane of Meath.</p>

<p>MacRoth came forward with the account of their first
company to the place where Ailill and Medb and Fergus
were and the nobles of the men of Erin. Ailill and Medb
asked tidings of him when he arrived. &quot;Come, macRoth,&quot;
quoth Ailill, &quot;tell us in what manner of array do the Ulstermen
advance to the hill of Slane in Meath?&quot; &quot;Truly, I
know not,&quot; answered macRoth, &quot;except <a name="footnotetag1_316" id="footnotetag1_316" href="#footnote1_316"><sup>1</sup></a>this alone:<a href="#footnote1_316"><sup>1</sup></a>
There came a fiery, powerful, most well-favoured company
upon the hill of Slane in Meath,&quot; said macRoth. &quot;It
seemed, on scanning and spying, that<a name="footnotetaga_316" id="footnotetaga_316" href="#footnotea_316"><sup>a</sup></a> thrice thirty hundred<a href="#footnotea_316"><sup>a</sup></a>
warriors were in it. <a name="footnotetag2_316" id="footnotetag2_316" href="#footnote2_316"><sup>2</sup></a>Anon<a href="#footnote2_316"><sup>2</sup></a> they all doffed their garments
and threw up a turfy mound for their leader to sit on. A
youth, slender, long, exceeding great of stature, fair to behold,
proud of mien, in the van of the troop. Fairest of
the princes of the world was he in the midst of his warriors,
as well in fearsomeness and in awe, in courage and command;
fair-yellow hair, curled, delicately arranged in
ridges and bushy had he <a name="footnotetag3_316" id="footnotetag3_316" href="#footnote3_316"><sup>3</sup></a>reaching to the nape of his neck;<a href="#footnote3_316"><sup>3</sup></a>
a comely, clear-rosy countenance he had, <a name="footnotetag4_316" id="footnotetag4_316" href="#footnote4_316"><sup>4</sup></a>narrow below
and broad above;<a href="#footnote4_316"><sup>4</sup></a> a deep-blue-grey, angry eye, devouring.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_317" name="Page_317" title="317">317</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5175.</span>
and fear-inspiring, in his head; a two-forked beard,
yellow, fairly curled, on his chin; a purple mantle with
fringes and five-folded wrapped around him; a <a name="footnotetag1_317" id="footnotetag1_317" href="#footnote1_317"><sup>1</sup></a>conspicuous,<a href="#footnote1_317"><sup>1</sup></a>
salmon-shaped brooch of <a name="footnotetag2_317" id="footnotetag2_317" href="#footnote2_317"><sup>2</sup></a>red<a href="#footnote2_317"><sup>2</sup></a> gold in the
mantle over his breast; a shining-white, hooded shirt
under red interweaving of red gold he wore next his white
skin; a bright-white shield with figures of beasts of red
gold thereon; a gold-hilted, hammered sword in one of
his hands; a broad and grey-green lance-head <a name="footnotetag3_317" id="footnotetag3_317" href="#footnote3_317"><sup>3</sup></a>on an ashen
shaft<a href="#footnote3_317"><sup>3</sup></a> in the other; <a name="footnotetag4_317" id="footnotetag4_317" href="#footnote4_317"><sup>4</sup></a>the pillar of a king's house on his
back.<a href="#footnote4_317"><sup>4</sup></a> That warrior took his station on the top of the
mound, so that each one came up to him and his company
took their places around him.</p>

<p>&quot;There came also another company to the same height
in Slane of Meath,&quot; continued macRoth. &quot;Second of
the two divisions of thirty hundred it was, <a name="footnotetag5_317" id="footnotetag5_317" href="#footnote5_317"><sup>5</sup></a>and next to
the other in numbers and attendance, in accoutrements
and fearfulness and horror.<a href="#footnote5_317"><sup>5</sup></a> A <a name="footnotetag6_317" id="footnotetag6_317" href="#footnote6_317"><sup>6</sup></a>great,<a href="#footnote6_317"><sup>6</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag7_317" id="footnotetag7_317" href="#footnote7_317"><sup>7</sup></a>hero-like,<a href="#footnote7_317"><sup>7</sup></a> well-favoured
warrior was there likewise at the head of that
company; fair-yellow hair he wore; a bright, curly beard
about his chin; a green mantle wrapped around him; a
bright-silvern pin in the mantle at his breast; a brown-red,
soldier's tunic under red interweaving of red gold
trussed up against his fair skin down to his knees; a candle
of a king's house<a name="footnotetaga_317" id="footnotetaga_317" href="#footnotea_317"><sup>a</sup></a> in his hand, with windings of silver and
bands of gold; wonderful the feats and games performed
with the spear in the hand of the youth; the windings of
silver ran round it by the side of the bands of gold, now
from the butt to the socket, while at other times it was the
bands of gold that circled by the side of the windings of
silver from socket to spear-end; a smiting shield with
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_318" name="Page_318" title="318">318</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5195.</span>
plaited edge he bore; a sword with hilt-pieces of ivory,
and ornamented with thread of gold on his left side. This
warrior took his station on the left of the leader<a name="footnotetag1_318" id="footnotetag1_318" href="#footnote1_318"><sup>1</sup></a> of the first
company<a href="#footnote1_318"><sup>1</sup></a> who had come to the mound, and his followers
got them seated around him. But, though we have said
they sat, they did not verily seat themselves at once, but
<a name="footnotetag2_318" id="footnotetag2_318" href="#footnote2_318"><sup>2</sup></a>they sat thus,<a href="#footnote2_318"><sup>2</sup></a> with their knees on the ground and the
rims of their shields against their chins, so long it seemed
to them till they should be let at us. But, one thing yet:
Meseemed that <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 97b.</span> the great, fierce youth who led the troop
stammered grievously <a name="footnotetag3_318" id="footnotetag3_318" href="#footnote3_318"><sup>3</sup></a>in his speech.<a href="#footnote3_318"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Still another battalion there came to the same mound
in Slane of Meath,&quot; continued macRoth. &quot;Second to its
fellow in number and followers and apparel. A handsome,
broad-headed warrior at the head of that troop; dark-yellow
hair in tresses he wore; an eager, dark-blue
eye rolling restlessly in his head; a bright, curled beard,
forked and tapering, at his chin; a dark-grey cloak with
fringes, folded around him; a leaf-shaped brooch of silvered
bronze in the mantle over his breast; a white-hooded shirt
<a name="footnotetag4_318" id="footnotetag4_318" href="#footnote4_318"><sup>4</sup></a>reaching to his knees<a href="#footnote4_318"><sup>4</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag5_318" id="footnotetag5_318" href="#footnote5_318"><sup>5</sup></a>was girded<a href="#footnote5_318"><sup>5</sup></a> next to his skin;
a bright shield with raised devices of beasts thereon he
bore; a sword with white silver hilt in battle-scabbard at
his waist; the pillar of a king's palace he bore on his back.
This warrior took his station on the hill of turf facing the
warrior who first came to the hill, and his company took
their places around him. But sweet as the tone of lutes
in masters' hands when long sustained, so seemed to me
the melodious sound of the voice and the speech of the
youth conversing with the warrior who first came to the
hill and offering him every counsel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But who might that be?&quot; asked Ailill of Fergus.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_319" name="Page_319" title="319">319</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5218.</span>
&quot;Truly, we know him well,&quot; Fergus made answer. &quot;This,
to wit, is the first hero for whom they threw up the mound
of turf on the height of the hill and whom all approached,
namely, Conchobar son of Fachtna Fathach son of Ross
Ruad son of Rudraige, High King of Ulster, and son of
the High King of Erin. <a name="footnotetag1_319" id="footnotetag1_319" href="#footnote1_319"><sup>1</sup></a>It is he that sat on the mound
of sods.<a href="#footnote1_319"><sup>1</sup></a> This, to wit, is the stammering, great warrior,&quot;
<a name="footnotetag2_319" id="footnotetag2_319" href="#footnote2_319"><sup>2</sup></a>Fergus continued,<a href="#footnote2_319"><sup>2</sup></a> &quot;who took station on <a name="footnotetag3_319" id="footnotetag3_319" href="#footnote3_319"><sup>3</sup></a>his father<a href="#footnote3_319"><sup>3</sup></a>
Conchobar's left, namely, Cuscraid Menn ('the Stammerer')
of Macha, Conchobar's son, with the sons of the king of
Ulster <a name="footnotetag4_319" id="footnotetag4_319" href="#footnote4_319"><sup>4</sup></a>and the sons of the princes of the men of Erin<a href="#footnote4_319"><sup>4</sup></a>
close by him. This is the spear he saw in his hand, even
the 'Torch of Cuscraid,' with its windings of silver and
bands of gold. It is the wont of that spear that neither
before nor after do the silver windings run round it by the
side of the bands of gold but only on the eve of a triumph.
Belike, it is almost before a triumph they course round it
now.</p>

<p>&quot;The well-favoured, broad-headed warrior who seated
himself on the hill in the presence of the youth who first
came on the mound, namely is Sencha son of Ailill son of
Maelcho 'the Eloquent' of Ulster, he that is wont to appease
the hosts of the men of Erin. But, yet a word more I say:
It is not the counsel of cowardice nor of fear that he gives
his lord this day on the day of strife, but counsel to act
with valour and courage and wisdom and cunning. But,
again one word further I say,&quot; added Fergus: &quot;It is a
goodly people for performing great deeds that has risen there
early this day around Conchobar!&quot; &quot;We make not much
of them,&quot; quoth Medb; &quot;we have goodly warriors and
stout youths to deal with them.&quot; &quot;I count not that for
much,&quot; answered Fergus again; &quot;but I say this word:
Thou wilt not find in Erin nor in Alba a host to be a match
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_320" name="Page_320" title="320">320</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5242.</span>
for the men of Ulster when once their anger comes upon
them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yet another company there came to the same mound in
Slane of Meath,&quot; said macRoth. <a name="footnotetag1_320" id="footnotetag1_320" href="#footnote1_320"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;Not fewer than a
battalion of thirty hundred was in it.<a href="#footnote1_320"><sup>1</sup></a> A fair, tall, great
warrior <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 98a.</span> in the van of that battalion, and he of fiery spirit,
with noble countenance. Brown, dark-coloured hair he
wore, smooth and thin on his forehead; a dull-grey cloak
girt around him; a silver pin in the cloak over his breast;
a bright, sleeved tunic next to his skin; a curved shield
with sharp, plaited rim he bore; a five-pronged spear in his
hand; a straightsword with ornaments of walrus-tooth
in its place.&quot; &quot;But, who might that be?&quot; asked Ailill of
Fergus. &quot;In very sooth, we know him,&quot; Fergus made
answer. &quot;The putting of hands on strife is he; a battle-warrior
for combat and destruction on foes is the one who
is come there, <a name="footnotetag2_320" id="footnotetag2_320" href="#footnote2_320"><sup>2</sup></a>even<a href="#footnote2_320"><sup>2</sup></a> Eogan son of Durthacht, <a name="footnotetag3_320" id="footnotetag3_320" href="#footnote3_320"><sup>3</sup></a>king of
the stout-handed<a href="#footnote3_320"><sup>3</sup></a> Fernmag in the north, is the one yonder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Another battalion there came thither to the same
mound in Slane of Meath,&quot; continued macRoth. &quot;It
is surely no false word that boldly they took the hill. Deep
the terror, great the fear they brought with them. <a name="footnotetag4_320" id="footnotetag4_320" href="#footnote4_320"><sup>4</sup></a>Terrible
the clangour of arms they made as they advanced.<a href="#footnote4_320"><sup>4</sup></a>
Their raiment all thrown back behind them. A great-headed,
warlike warrior in the forefront of the company,
and he eager for blood, dreadful to look upon; spare, grizzly
hair had he; huge, yellow eyes in his head; a yellow, close-napped (?)
cloak around him; a pin of yellow gold in the
cloak over his breast; a yellow tunic with lace next his
skin; <a name="footnotetag5_320" id="footnotetag5_320" href="#footnote5_320"><sup>5</sup></a>a great, smiting sword under his waist;<a href="#footnote5_320"><sup>5</sup></a> in his
hand a nailed, broad-plated, long-shafted spear with a drop
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_321" name="Page_321" title="321">321</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5262.</span>
of blood on its edge.&quot; &quot;But, who might that be?&quot; asked
Ailill of Fergus. &quot;In truth then, we know him, that
warrior,&quot; Fergus gave answer. &quot;Neither battle nor battle-field
nor combat nor contest shuns he, the one who is come
thither. Loegaire Buadach ('the Victorious') son of Connad
Buid&egrave; ('the Yellow') son of Iliach, from Immail in the north,
is the one yonder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Another company there came there too to the same
mound in Slane of Meath,&quot; continued macRoth. &quot;A thick-necked,
burly warrior at the head of that troop; black,
bushy hair he had; a scarred, crimsoned face he had; a
deep-blue-grey, blazing eye in his head; a spear set with
eyes of glass, casting shadows over him; a black shield
with a hard rim of silvered bronze upon him; a dun-coloured
cloak of curly wool about him; a brooch of pale
gold in the cloak over his breast; a three-striped tunic of
silk <a name="footnotetag1_321" id="footnotetag1_321" href="#footnote1_321"><sup>1</sup></a>with red embroidery<a href="#footnote1_321"><sup>1</sup></a> next to his skin; a sword with
ivory hilt and with ornamentation of thread of gold over
his dress on the outside.&quot; &quot;But, who might that man be?&quot;
asked Ailill of Fergus. &quot;We know him full well,&quot; Fergus
made answer. &quot;He is the putting of hand on strife; a
wave of the high sea that drowneth <a name="footnotetag2_321" id="footnotetag2_321" href="#footnote2_321"><sup>2</sup></a>the small streams;<a href="#footnote2_321"><sup>2</sup></a>
he is the man of three shouts; the sea over walls; <a name="footnotetag3_321" id="footnotetag3_321" href="#footnote3_321"><sup>3</sup></a>the
venomous destruction of enemies,<a href="#footnote3_321"><sup>3</sup></a> the man who comes
thither. Muremur ('Thick-neck') son of Gerrcend ('Short-head')
from Moduirn in the north is the one yonder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Still another company there came to the same mound in
Slane of Meath,&quot; continued macRoth. <a name="footnotetag4_321" id="footnotetag4_321" href="#footnote4_321"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;Not fewer
than thirty hundred, the battle line of the troops.<a href="#footnote4_321"><sup>4</sup></a> A
<a name="footnotetag5_321" id="footnotetag5_321" href="#footnote5_321"><sup>5</sup></a>broad-headed,<a href="#footnote5_321"><sup>5</sup></a> stout warrior, pleasantly found of limb,
in the front of that troop; he is dried and sallow; he is
wild and bull-like; a dun, round eye, proud in his head;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_322" name="Page_322" title="322">322</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5283.</span>
yellow, very curly is his hair; a red, round shield with hard-silver
rim about it he bore; a <a name="footnotetag1_322" id="footnotetag1_322" href="#footnote1_322"><sup>1</sup></a>trebly riveted,<a href="#footnote1_322"><sup>1</sup></a> broad-plated,
long-shafted spear in his hand; a streaked-grey
cloak around him; a salmon-shaped brooch of copper in
the cloak over his breast; a hooded kirtle girded around
him reaching down to his calves; a straightsword with
ornaments of walrus-tooth on his left thigh.&quot; &quot;But who
might he be?&quot; <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 98b.</span> asked Ailill of Fergus. &quot;I know him
indeed,&quot; Fergus made answer. &quot;He is the prop of battle;
<a name="footnotetag2_322" id="footnotetag2_322" href="#footnote2_322"><sup>2</sup></a>he is the wild heat of anger; he is the daring of every
battle;<a href="#footnote2_322"><sup>2</sup></a> he is the triumph of every combat; he is the
tool that pierces, is the man who comes thither. Connud
macMorna, from the Callann in the north, is the man
yonder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There came still another company to the same mound
in Slane of Meath,&quot; continued macRoth. <a name="footnotetag3_322" id="footnotetag3_322" href="#footnote3_322"><sup>3</sup></a>&quot;A company
most fair to look upon, most notable both in numbers and
in attendance and apparel.<a href="#footnote3_322"><sup>3</sup></a> It is indeed no lying word, it
is with might and storm they gained the hill, so that <a name="footnotetag4_322" id="footnotetag4_322" href="#footnote4_322"><sup>4</sup></a>with
the clash of arms they made at the approach of that company<a href="#footnote4_322"><sup>4</sup></a>
they startled the hosts that had arrived there before
them. A man, comely and noble, in advance of that band;
most well-favoured to see of the men of the world, whether
in shape or form or frame; <a name="footnotetag5_322" id="footnotetag5_322" href="#footnote5_322"><sup>5</sup></a>whether in hair or eyes or
fearfulness; whether in voice or brightness or knowledge
or adornment; whether in rank or wisdom or kindred;<a href="#footnote5_322"><sup>5</sup></a>
whether in arms or apparel; whether in size or worth or
beauty; whether in figure or valour or conduct.&quot; <a name="footnotetag6_322" id="footnotetag6_322" href="#footnote6_322"><sup>6</sup></a>&quot;Who
might that man be, O Fergus?&quot; asked Ailill.<a href="#footnote6_322"><sup>6</sup></a> &quot;Then it
is surely no lying word,&quot; Fergus made answer: &quot;A fitting
saying is this, 'No fool 'mongst the naked'<a name="footnotetaga_322" id="footnotetaga_322" href="#footnotea_322"><sup>a</sup></a> is he who
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_323" name="Page_323" title="323">323</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5299.</span>
comes thither. He is the foe of all others; he is a power
irresistible; the storm-wave that drowneth, the glitter of
ice is that well-favoured man. Fedilmid <a name="footnotetag1_323" id="footnotetag1_323" href="#footnote1_323"><sup>1</sup></a>son of<a href="#footnote1_323"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_323" id="footnotetag2_323" href="#footnote2_323"><sup>2</sup></a>Ilar

to his enemies.&quot;<a href="#footnote3_323"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Still another battalion came thither to the same hill
in Slane of Meath,&quot; macRoth proceeded. <a name="footnotetag4_323" id="footnotetag4_323" href="#footnote4_323"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;It is the

along with a cutting bye-spear of attack, with thongs for
throwing, with fastenings of silvered bronze, in his
hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But who might that man be?&quot; asked Ailill of Fergus.
&quot;We know him full well,&quot; Fergus made answer. &quot;He is
half of a battle; he is the dividing<a name="footnotetaga_324" id="footnotetaga_324" href="#footnotea_324"><sup>a</sup></a> of combat; he is the
wild rage of a watchhound, the man who is come thither;
Rochad son of Fatheman, from Rigdonn in the north, is he
yonder. <a name="footnotetag1_324" id="footnotetag1_324" href="#footnote1_324"><sup>1</sup></a>Your son-in-law is he<a href="#footnote1_324"><sup>1</sup></a>; <a name="footnotetag2_324" id="footnotetag2_324" href="#footnote2_324"><sup>2</sup></a>he wedded your

brought neither marriage-gift nor bride-price to her.&quot;<a href="#footnote3_324"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Another battalion there came to the same hill in Slane
of Meath,&quot; continued macRoth. &quot;A stalwart, thick-thighed,
<a name="footnotetag4_324" id="footnotetag4_324" href="#footnote4_324"><sup>4</sup></a>gross-calved<a href="#footnote4_324"><sup>4</sup></a> warrior at the head of that company;
little but every limb of him as stout as a man. Verily it
is no lying word, he is a man down to the ground,&quot; said he.
&quot;Brown, bushy hair upon his head; a round-faced, ruddy
countenance <a name="footnotetag5_324" id="footnotetag5_324" href="#footnote5_324"><sup>5</sup></a>covered with scars<a href="#footnote5_324"><sup>5</sup></a> he had; a flashing,
proud eye in his head; a splendid, dexterous man was there,
in this wise: Accompanied by black-haired, black-eyed
youths; with a red, flaming banner; <a name="footnotetag6_324" id="footnotetag6_324" href="#footnote6_324"><sup>6</sup></a>with terror and
fearsomeness; with wonderful appearance, both of arms
and apparel and raiment and countenance and splendour;
with converse of heroes; with champions' deeds;<a href="#footnote6_324"><sup>6</sup></a> with
wilful rashness, so that they seek to rout overwhelming
numbers outside of equal combat, <a name="footnotetag7_324" id="footnotetag7_324" href="#footnote7_324"><sup>7</sup></a>with their wrath upon
foes, with raids into hostile lands,<a href="#footnote7_324"><sup>7</sup></a> with the violence of

Conchobar. <a name="footnotetag1_325" id="footnotetag1_325" href="#footnote1_325"><sup>1</sup></a>It is no lying word, stiffly they made their
march, that company to Slane of Meath.&quot;<a href="#footnote1_325"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;But, who might he be?&quot; asked Ailill of Fergus. &quot;Aye
then we know him,&quot; Fergus made answer. &quot;A thirst for
valour and prowess; a thirst for madness and fury; <a name="footnotetag2_325" id="footnotetag2_325" href="#footnote2_325"><sup>2</sup></a>a
man of strength and of courage, of pride and of greatness of

that is, his shield, he bore on him; a tough, obdurate,
straight-bladed sword for a hero's handling hung high on his
left side. A straight, fluted spear, flaming red <a name="footnotetag12_325" id="footnotetag12_325" href="#footnote12_325"><sup>12</sup></a>and venomous<a href="#footnote12_325"><sup>12</sup></a>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_326" name="Page_326" title="326">326</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5342.</span>
Ailill of Fergus. &quot;Truly, we know him well,&quot; Fergus made
answer. <a name="footnotetag1_326" id="footnotetag1_326" href="#footnote1_326"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;Fiery is the manner of the warlike champion
who has so come thither.<a href="#footnote1_326"><sup>1</sup></a> The choice flower of royal poets

goal; fierce is his valour, the man that came thither;

noble poet from the Buas in the north, is he.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There came yet another company there to the same
hill in Slane of Meath,&quot; continued macRoth. &quot;A fair,
yellow-haired hero in the front rank of that band. Fair
was the man, both in hair and eye and beard and eyebrows
and apparel; a rimmed shield he bore; a gold-hilted,
overlaid sword on his left side; in his hand, a five-pointed
spear that reflected its glare over the entire host, <a name="footnotetag2_326" id="footnotetag2_326" href="#footnote2_326"><sup>2</sup></a>and a
hollow lance in his hand. Hero-like was his coming!&quot;<a href="#footnote2_326"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;But who was that man?&quot; asked Ailill of Fergus. &quot;In
sooth, we know him well,&quot; Fergus made answer. &quot;Cherished,
in truth, is that warrior by the people, he that to us is come
thither; cherished, the stout-blow-dealing beast; cherished,
the bear of great deeds against foes, <a name="footnotetag3_326" id="footnotetag3_326" href="#footnote3_326"><sup>3</sup></a>with the violence of
his attack.<a href="#footnote3_326"><sup>3</sup></a> Feradach Finn Fectnach ('the Fair and

<p><a name="footnotetag4_326" id="footnotetag4_326" href="#footnote4_326"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;Another company there came to the mound in Slane

in the front rank of that company. Three cloaks of the

hands.&quot; &quot;Who were those men there?&quot; Ailill asked.
&quot;I know,&quot; Fergus answered; &quot;the three princes of Roth,
the three champions of Colph, the three of Midluachair,
great in achievements, three seasoned warriors of the east
of Erin, to wit, the three sons of Fiachna in quest of their
bull are there, even Ros and Dar&egrave; and Imchad, for theirs
was the possession of the Brown Bull of Cualnge. Even
had they come alone, they would have offered you battle
in defence of their bull and their drove, even though before
them the enemy should not be routed.&quot;<a name="footnotetag4_327" id="footnotetag4_327" href="#footnote4_326"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Yet another company there came thither to the same
hill in Slane of Meath,&quot; said macRoth. &quot;Two <a name="footnotetag3_327" id="footnotetag3_327" href="#footnote3_327"><sup>3</sup></a>fair,<a href="#footnote3_327"><sup>3</sup></a>
tender, young warriors at the head of that company, <a name="footnotetag5_327" id="footnotetag5_327" href="#footnote5_327"><sup>5</sup></a>and
both wholly alike. Brown, curly hair on the head of one
of them; fair, yellow hair on that of the other;<a href="#footnote5_327"><sup>5</sup></a> two green
cloaks wrapped about them; two bright-silver brooches in
the cloaks over their breasts; two tunics of smooth yellow
silk next to their skin; bright-hilted swords on their belts;
<a name="footnotetag6_327" id="footnotetag6_327" href="#footnote6_327"><sup>6</sup></a>two bright shields with devious figures of beasts in silver;<a href="#footnote6_327"><sup>6</sup></a>
two five-pronged spears with windings of pure bright silver
in their hands. Moreover, their years were nigh the same.
<a name="footnotetag7_327" id="footnotetag7_327" href="#footnote7_327"><sup>7</sup></a>Together they lifted their feet and set them down again,
for it was not their way for either of them to lift up his feet
past the other.&quot;<a href="#footnote7_327"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;But, who might they be?&quot; asked Ailill of Fergus.
&quot;Well do we know them,&quot; Fergus made answer. &quot;Two
single, strong-necked champions are they; two united
flames; two united torches; two champions; two heroes;
two ridge-poles of hosts<a name="footnotetaga_327" id="footnotetaga_327" href="#footnotea_327"><sup>a</sup></a>; two dragons; two thunderbolts;
two destroyers (?); two boars; two bold ones; two mad

son of Ross Ruad son of Rudraige.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There came also another company to that same
mound,&quot; said macRoth. &quot;'Tis the engulphing of the
sea for size; red-flaming fire <a name="footnotetag2_328" id="footnotetag2_328" href="#footnote2_328"><sup>2</sup></a>for splendour;<a href="#footnote2_328"><sup>2</sup></a> a legion

his shoulders to the other; a rough, three-striped tunic
next to his skin; a sword of seven charges of remelted
iron he bore on his rump; a brown hillock he bore,
namely his shield; a great, grey spear with thirty nails
driven through its socket he had in his hand. But, what
need to tell further? <a name="footnotetag6_328" id="footnotetag6_328" href="#footnote6_328"><sup>6</sup></a>All the host arose to meet him,

battle-hosts with him.&quot;<a href="#footnote7_328"><sup>7</sup></a> &quot;But who might that man be?&quot;
asked Ailill of Fergus. &quot;Ah, but we know him well,&quot;

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 5397.</span>
&quot;There came yet another company thither to the same
hill in Slane of Meath,&quot; said macRoth; &quot;one that is firm
and furious; one that is ugly and fearful. A great-bellied,
big-mouthed champion, <a name="footnotetag1_329" id="footnotetag1_329" href="#footnote1_329"><sup>1</sup></a>the size of whose mouth
is the mouth of a horse,<a href="#footnote1_329"><sup>1</sup></a> in the van of that troop; with

very curly hair he wore; a black, flowing mantle around
him; a wheel-shaped brooch of tin in the mantle over his
breast; a cunningly wrought tunic next to his skin; a
great long sword under his waist; a well-tempered lance
in his right hand; <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 99b.</span> a grey buckler he bore on him, that is,
his shield.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pray, who might that man be?&quot; asked Ailill of Fergus.
&quot;Indeed, but we know him,&quot; Fergus made answer; &quot;the

<p>&quot;Now who might he be?&quot; asked Ailill of Fergus. &quot;Well

in Slane of Meath,&quot; continued macRoth. <a name="footnotetag4_331" id="footnotetag4_331" href="#footnote4_331"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;Vaster than
a division of three thousand was its appearance.<a href="#footnote4_331"><sup>4</sup></a> A large,

company. Like to Ailill yonder, with his pointed weapons,
the restrainer, both in features and noble bearing and
fairness, both in arms and apparel, in valour and bravery
and fame and deeds. A blue shield <a name="footnotetag6_331" id="footnotetag6_331" href="#footnote6_331"><sup>6</sup></a>adapted for striking,<a href="#footnote6_331"><sup>6</sup></a>

exceeding fine cloak folded about him; a brooch of gold
in the cloak over his breast; a tunic with red ornaments
about him;<a href="#footnote10_331"><sup>10</sup></a> a golden crown on his head.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, who might that be?&quot; asked Ailill of Fergus.
&quot;Ah, but we know him well,&quot; Fergus made answer.
<a name="footnotetag11_331" id="footnotetag11_331" href="#footnote11_331"><sup>11</sup></a>&quot;Truly, the sea over rivers is the one that is come thither;
the wild rage of fire; not to be borne is his wrath against
foes;<a href="#footnote11_331"><sup>11</sup></a> the root of all manhood; the assault of overwhelming
power; the annihilation of men is he that is come
thither. Furbaide Ferbenn son of Conchobar, from Sil in

<p><a name="footnotetag12_331" id="footnotetag12_331" href="#footnote12_331"><sup>12</sup></a>&quot;Yet another company came to the mound in Slane

of Meath,&quot; continued macRoth. &quot;A sharp, proud folk;
a stately, royal company, with their apparel of many colours,
as well white and blue and black and purple, so that to a
king could be likened each spirited, chosen man in the noble,
most wonderful troop. A feast for the eyes of a host, to
gaze on their comeliness and their garb, as if it was going
forth to some great surpassing assembly was each single
man of that company. A trine of noble, distinguished
men were in the front rank of that company. The first
man of them with a dark-grey mantle fringed with gold
thread about him; a brooch of gold in the mantle over
his breast; a tunic of rare silk next to his skin; sandals
of lamb's skin he wore. Not many men in the world are
better-favoured than is he. A light-yellow head of hair
he has; a bright-faced sword with ivory hilt and with coils
of gold thread, in his right hand. He flings on high the
tooth-hilted sword, so that it falls on the head of the middle
man but it simply grazes it. He catches it up in the air
again, so that it falls on the head of the other man, and the
first man catches it in his hand, and it divided not a ringlet
nor the skin of the head of either of them, and these two
men did not perceive it. Two brown, rich-hued, bright-faced
youths; reddish-grey mantles around them; white-silver
brooches in their mantles over their breasts; a bright-hilted
sword under their waists; purple sandals they wore;
as sweet as strings of lutes when long sustained in players'
hands was the voice and song of one of the men, so that
enough of delight it was to the host to listen to the sound
of his voice. Worthy of a king or of a prince was each
man in that company as regards apparel and appearance;
thou wouldst think, at the sight of them, they were all kings.
Neither spears nor swords do they bear, but their servants
bear them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An over-proud body is that,&quot; quoth Ailill; &quot;and who
may they be, O Fergus?&quot; he asked. &quot;I know full well,&quot;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_333" name="Page_333" title="333">333</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5466.</span>
replied Fergus; &quot;the poets of Ulster are they, with that
Fercerdne the fair, much-gifted, whom thou sawest, even
the learned master of Ulster, Fercerdne. 'Tis before him
that the lakes and rivers sink when he upbraids, and they
swell up high when he applauds. The two others thou
sawest are Athirn&egrave; the chief poet, whom none can deny,
and Ailill Miltenga ('Honey-tongue') son of Carba; and
he is called Ailill 'Honey-tongue' for that as sweet as
honey are the words of wisdom that fall from him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There came yet another company to the mound in
Slane of Meath,&quot; said macRoth. &quot;A most terrible, dreadful
sight to behold them. Blue and pied and green, purple,
grey and white and black mantles; a kingly, white-grey,
broad-eyed hero in the van of that company; wavy, grizzled
hair upon him; a blue-purple cloak about him; a leaf-shaped
brooch with ornamentation of gold in the cloak
over his breast; a shield, stoutly braced with buckles of
red copper; yellow sandals he wore; a large, strange-fashioned
sword along his shoulder. Two curly-haired,
white-faced youths close by him, wearing green cloaks and
purple sandals and blue tunics, and with brown shields
fitted with hooks, in their hands; white-hilted swords with
silvered bronze ornaments they bore; a broad, somewhat
light countenance had one of them. One of these cunning
men raises his glance to heaven and scans the clouds of the
sky and bears their answer to the marvellous troop that
is with him. They all lift their eyes on high and watch
the clouds and work their spells against the elements, so
that the elements fall to warring with each other, till they
discharge rain-clouds of fire downwards on the camp and
entrenchments of the men of Erin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who might that be, O Fergus?&quot; asked Ailill. &quot;I
know him,&quot; replied Fergus; &quot;the foundation of knowledge;
the master of the elements; the heaven-soaring
one; he that blindeth the eyes; that depriveth his foe
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_334" name="Page_334" title="334">334</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5488.</span>
of his strength through incantations of druids, namely
Cathba the friendly druid, with the druids of Ulster about
him. And to this end he makes augury when judging the
elements, in order to ascertain therefrom how the great
battle on Garech and Ilgarech will end. The two youths
that are about him, they are his own two sons, to wit Imrinn
son of Cathba and Genonn Gruadsolus ('Bright-cheek')
son of Cathba, he that has the somewhat light countenance.
Howbeit it will be hard for the men of Erin to withstand
the spells of the druids.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yet another company there came to the mound in
Slane of Meath,&quot; continued macRoth. &quot;A numberless,
bright-faced band; unwonted garments they wore; a
little bag at the waist of each man of them. A white-haired,
bull-faced man in the front of that company; an eager,
dragon-like eye in his head; a black, flowing robe with
edges of purple around him; a many coloured, leaf-shaped
brooch with gems, in the robe over his breast; a ribbed
tunic of thread of gold around him; a short sword, keen
and hard, with plates of gold, in his hand; they all came
to show him their stabs and their sores, their wounds and
their ills, and he told each one his sickness, and he gave
each a cure, and what at last happened to each was even
the ill he foretold him.&quot; &quot;He is the power of leechcraft; he
is the healing of wounds; he is the thwarting of death;
he is the absence of every weakness, is that man,&quot; said
Fergus, &quot;namely Fingin the prophet mediciner, the physician
of Conchobar, with the leeches of Ulster around him.
It is he that knoweth the sickness of a man by the smoke
of the house wherein he lies, or by hearing his groans.
Their medicine bags are the sacks which thou sawest with
them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Another company came to the mound in Slane of
Meath,&quot; continued macRoth. &quot;A powerful, heavy, turbulent
company; they caused uproar in their deeds of arms
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_335" name="Page_335" title="335">335</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5512.</span>
for the accomplishment of brilliant feats;<a name="footnotetaga_335" id="footnotetaga_335" href="#footnotea_335"><sup>a</sup></a> they tore up
the sad-sodded earth with the strength of their bitter rage,
for the mighty princes of the proud province of Conchobar
would not allow them to proceed to the great camp till all
should be arrived. Two youths, swarthy and huge, in the
front of that company; soft, playful eyes in their heads;
about them, dark-grey tunics with silver pins set with
stones; great, horn-topped swords with sheaths they bore;
strong, stout shields they bore; hollow lances with rows
of rivets, in their hands; glossy tunics next to their skin.&quot;
&quot;We know well that company,&quot; quoth Fergus; &quot;the household
of Conchobar and his vassals are those; their two
leaders, Glasn&egrave; and Menn, two sons of Uthechar.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There came yet another band to the mound in Slane
of Meath,&quot; continued macRoth; &quot;to wit, a band of a
numerous body of henchmen. A black, hasty, swarthy, ...,
man in the front rank of that band; seven chains around
his neck; seven men at the end of each chain; these seven
groups of men he drags along, so that their faces strike
against the ground, and they revile him until he desists.
Another terrible man is there, and the ponderous stone
which powerful men could not raise, he sets on his palm
and flings on high to the height a lark flies on a day of fine
weather; a club of iron at his belt.&quot; &quot;I know those men,&quot;
quoth Fergus: &quot;Triscoth the strong man of Conchobar's
house; it is he that flings the stone on high. Ercenn son
of the three stewards, he it is in the chains.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There came <a name="footnotetag1_335" id="footnotetag1_335" href="#footnote1_335"><sup>1</sup></a>another<a href="#footnote1_335"><sup>1</sup></a> large, stately company to the
mound in Slane of Meath,&quot; macRoth went on. &quot;Three,
very curly-headed, white-faced youths in the van of that
troop; three curly-red kirtles with brooches of silvered
bronze was the apparel they wore about them; three
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_336" name="Page_336" title="336">336</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5535.</span>
sparkling tunics of silk with golden seams tucked up about
them; three studded shields with images of beasts for
emblems in silvered bronze upon them and with bosses of
red gold; three very keen swords with guards adorned
with gold thread along their shoulders; broad-bladed
javelin-heads on ashen shafts in their hands.&quot; &quot;Who
might that be there, O Fergus?&quot; asked Ailill. &quot;That I
know,&quot; answered Fergus: &quot;the three venoms of serpents;
three cutting ones; three edges; three watchful ones;
three points of combat; three pillars of the borders; three
powerful companies of Ulster; three wardens of Erin;
three triumph-singers of a mighty host are there,&quot; said
Fergus, &quot;the three sons of Conchobar, namely Glas and
Man&egrave; and Conaing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yet another company there came to the mound in
Slane of Meath,&quot; said macRoth. &quot;Stately, in beautiful
colours, gleaming-bright they came to the mound. Not
fewer than an army-division, as a glance might judge them.
A bold, fair-cheeked youth in the van of that troop; light-yellow
hair has he; though a bag of red-shelled nuts were
spilled on his crown, not a nut of them would fall to the
ground because of the twisted, curly locks of his head.
Bluish-grey as harebell is one of his eyes; as black as
beetle's back is the other; the one brow black, the other
white; a forked, light-yellow beard has he; a magnificent
red-brown mantle about him; a round brooch adorned
with gems of precious stones fastening it in his mantle over
his right shoulder; a striped tunic of silk with a golden
hem next to his skin; an ever-bright shield he bore; a
hard-smiting, threatening spear he held over him; a very
keen sword with hilt-piece of red gold on his thigh.&quot; &quot;Who
might that be, O Fergus?&quot; asked Ailill. &quot;I know, then,&quot;
replied Fergus: &quot;it is battle against foes; it is the inciting
of strife; it is the rage of a monster; it is the madness
of a lion; it is the cunning of a snake; it is the rock of the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_337" name="Page_337" title="337">337</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5558.</span>
Badb; it is the sea over dikes; it is the shaking of rocks;
it is the stirring of a wild host, namely Conall Cernach
('the Victorious'), the high-glorious son of Amargin, that
is come hither.&quot;<a name="footnotetag12_337" id="footnotetag12_337" href="#footnote12_337"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Yet another company came to the same mound in
Slane of Meath,&quot; said macRoth. <a name="footnotetag1_337" id="footnotetag1_337" href="#footnote1_337"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;Very heroic and
without number it is;<a href="#footnote1_337"><sup>1</sup></a> steady and dissimilar to the other
companies. <a name="footnotetag2_337" id="footnotetag2_337" href="#footnote2_337"><sup>2</sup></a>Strange garments, unlike the other companies
they wore. Famously have they come, both in
arms and raiment and dress. A great host and fierce is
that company.<a href="#footnote2_337"><sup>2</sup></a> Some wore red cloaks, others light-blue
cloaks, <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 100a.</span> others dark blue cloaks, others green cloaks;
white and yellow jerkins, beautiful and shiny, were over
them. Behold the little, freckled, red-faced lad with
purple, <a name="footnotetag3_337" id="footnotetag3_337" href="#footnote3_337"><sup>3</sup></a>fringed<a href="#footnote3_337"><sup>3</sup></a> mantle <a name="footnotetag4_337" id="footnotetag4_337" href="#footnote4_337"><sup>4</sup></a>folded about him<a href="#footnote4_337"><sup>4</sup></a> amongst
them in their midst. <a name="footnotetag5_337" id="footnotetag5_337" href="#footnote5_337"><sup>5</sup></a>Fairest of the forms of men was
his form.<a href="#footnote5_337"><sup>5</sup></a> A salmon-shaped brooch of gold in the mantle
over his breast; a <a name="footnotetag6_337" id="footnotetag6_337" href="#footnote6_337"><sup>6</sup></a>bright, hooded<a href="#footnote6_337"><sup>6</sup></a> tunic of royal silk
with red trimming of red gold next to his white skin; a
bright shield with intricate figures of beasts in red gold
upon it; a boss of gold on the shield; an edge of gold
around it; a small, gold-hilted sword at his waist; a
sharp, light lance cast its shadow over him.&quot; &quot;But, who
might he be?&quot; asked Ailill of Fergus. &quot;Truly, I know
not,&quot; Fergus made answer, &quot;that I left behind me in Ulster
the like of that company nor of the little lad that is in it.
But, one thing I think likely, that they are the men of Temair
with <a name="footnotetag7_337" id="footnotetag7_337" href="#footnote7_337"><sup>7</sup></a>the well-favoured, wonderful, noble youth<a href="#footnote7_337"><sup>7</sup></a> Erc
son of Fedilmid Nocruthach, <a name="footnotetag8_337" id="footnotetag8_337" href="#footnote8_337"><sup>8</sup></a>Conchobar's daughter,<a href="#footnote8_337"><sup>8</sup></a> and
of Carbre Niafer. And if it be they, they are not more
friends than their leaders here. Mayhap despite his father
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_338" name="Page_338" title="338">338</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5576.</span>
has this lad come to succour his grandfather<a name="footnotetaga_338" id="footnotetaga_338" href="#footnotea_338"><sup>a</sup></a> at this
time. And if these they be, a sea that drowneth shall
this company be to ye, because it is through this company
and the little lad that is in it that the battle shall this time
be won against ye.&quot; &quot;How through him?&quot; asked Ailill.
&quot;Not hard to tell,&quot; Fergus responded: &quot;for this little lad
will know neither fear nor dread when slaying and slaughtering,
until at length he comes into the midst of your battalion.
Then shall be heard the whirr of Conchobar's sword
like the yelp of a howling war-hound, or like a lion rushing
among bears, <a name="footnotetag1_338" id="footnotetag1_338" href="#footnote1_338"><sup>1</sup></a>while the boy will be saved.<a href="#footnote1_338"><sup>1</sup></a> Then outside
around the battle lines will Conchobar pile up huge
walls of men's bodies <a name="footnotetag2_338" id="footnotetag2_338" href="#footnote2_338"><sup>2</sup></a>while he seeks the little lad.<a href="#footnote2_338"><sup>2</sup></a>
In turn the princes of the men of Ulster, filled with
love and devotion, will hew the enemy to pieces. Boldly
will those powerful bulls, <a name="footnotetag3_338" id="footnotetag3_338" href="#footnote3_338"><sup>3</sup></a>the brave warriors of Ulster,<a href="#footnote3_338"><sup>3</sup></a>
bellow as <a name="footnotetag4_338" id="footnotetag4_338" href="#footnote4_338"><sup>4</sup></a>their grandson,<a href="#footnote4_338"><sup>4</sup></a> the calf of their <a name="footnotetag5_338" id="footnotetag5_338" href="#footnote5_338"><sup>5</sup></a>cow,<a href="#footnote5_338"><sup>5</sup></a> is rescued
in the battle on the morn of the morrow.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag6_338" id="footnotetag6_338" href="#footnote6_338"><sup>6</sup></a>&quot;Then came there three huge (?), strong, well-braced,
cunningly-built castles; three mighty, wheeled-towers
like unto mountains, in this wise placed in position: Three
royal castles with their thirty fully armed battalions,
swarming with evil-tongued warriors and with thirty
round-shielded heroes. A bright, beautiful, glistening
shield-guard was on each of the three strong, stout battle-castles,
with black, deadly armament of huge, high, blue,
sharp pine-lances, such that one's bent knee would fit in
the socket of each smooth, polished, even and hard spear-head
that is on each huge, terrible, strange shaft of the
terrible, awful, heavy, monstrous, indescribable armament
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_339" name="Page_339" title="339">339</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5598.</span>
that I saw. A third part of each shaft was contained in
the socket of the riveted, very long, securely placed spears;
as high as <a name="footnotetag1_339" id="footnotetag1_339" href="#footnote1_339"><sup>1</sup></a>two<a href="#footnote1_339"><sup>1</sup></a> cubits was each citadel from the ground;
as long as a warrior's spear was the height of each battle-hurdle;
as sharp as charmed sword was the blade of each
sickle on the sides and the flanks of each of <a name="footnotetag2_339" id="footnotetag2_339" href="#footnote2_339"><sup>2</sup></a>Badb's hurdles;<a href="#footnote2_339"><sup>2</sup></a>
on each of the three stout and hard battle-hurdles
they are to be found. Four dark, yet gleaming, well-adorned
doors were on each battle-wheeled tower of the
three royal wheeled-towers which were displayed and spread
over the plain, with ivory door-posts, with lintels of cypress,
with stately thresholds set of speckled, beautiful, strong
pine, with their blue, glass door-leaves, with the glitter
of crystal gems around each door-frame, so that its appearance
from afar was like that of bright shining stars. As
loud as the crash of a mighty wave at the great spring-tide,
or of a huge heavy fleet upon the sea when toiling with
the oars along the shore, was the similitude of the din and
the clamour and the shouts and the tumult of the multitude
and the to-and-fro of the thirty champions with their thirty
heavy, iron clubs that they bear in their hands. And when
the wheeled-towers advance massively and boldly against
the line of heroes, these almost leave behind their arms at
the fierce charge of the outland battalions. Then spring
the three hundred champions with a shout of vengeful
anger over the sides and over the front of the huge iron
towers on wheels, so that this it was that checked the swift
course and the great, hasty onslaught of the well-grounded,
swiftly-moving, mighty chariots. The three stout, strong,
battle-proof towers on wheels careered over rough places
and over obstacles, over rocks and over heights. There
coursed the thirty entire chargers, powerful, strong-backed,
four abreast, the equal of ninety entire chargers, with
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_340" name="Page_340" title="340">340</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5622.</span>
manes more than big, bold<a name="footnotetaga_340" id="footnotetaga_340" href="#footnotea_340"><sup>a</sup></a> and leaping, with sack-like,
distended nostrils, high-headed, towering, over-powering,
wonderful, so that they shook with their ramping the thick
shell of the sad-sodded earth. They flecked the plain
behind them with the foam dripping from the <a name="footnotetag1_340" id="footnotetag1_340" href="#footnote1_340"><sup>1</sup></a>swift<a href="#footnote1_340"><sup>1</sup></a>
Danish steeds, from the bits and bridles, from the traces and
tracks of the huge, maned, mighty<a name="footnotetagb_340" id="footnotetagb_340" href="#footnoteb_340"><sup>b</sup></a> steeds, greater than
can be told! They excited strife with their din of arms.
They plunged headlong in their swift impatience. They
aroused great terror at their accoutrement, at their armour,
at their cunning, at their power, at their hugeness, at their
destructive, terrible, hostile vengeance on the four grand,
proud provinces of Erin. Amazing to me was their appearance
because of the unwontedness of their trappings both
in form and in garb. Three wonderful flights of birds with
variety of appearance hovered over them. The first flock
was all red, the second flock was white as swans, the third
flock as black as ravens. Three red-mouthed, crow-shaped
demons of battle sped around them as swift as hares, circling
the three wheeled towers, and this is what they prophesied:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>&quot;They wheeled about and brought them twelve<a name="footnotetagd_340" id="footnotetagd_340" href="#footnoted_340"><sup>d</sup></a> battle-pillars
of thick, huge, iron pillars. As thick as the middle
of a warrior's thigh, as tall as a champion's spear was each
battle-fork of them, and they placed four forks under each
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_341" name="Page_341" title="341">341</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5646.</span>
wheeled-tower. And their horses all ran from them and
grazed upon the plain. And those forty<a name="footnotetaga_341" id="footnotetaga_341" href="#footnotea_341"><sup>a</sup></a> that had gone
in advance descend clad in armour on the plain, and the
garrison of the three battle-wheeled towers falls to attacking
and harassing them, and is attacked and harassed in
turn by those forty champions, so that there was heard the
breaking of shields and the loud blows of hard iron poles
on bucklers and battle-helmets, on coats of mail and on the
iron plates of smooth, hard, blue-black, sharp-beaked,
fork&egrave;d spears. And in the whole camp there is none but
is on the watch for their fierceness and their wrath and
their cunning and their strangeness, for their fury, their
achievements and the excellence of their guard. And in
the place where the forty champions are and the thousand
armed men contending with them, not one of the thousand
had a wounding stroke nor a blow on his opponent because
of the might of their skill in arms and the excellence
of their defence withal!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are hard to contend with for all such as are unfamiliar
with them, is the opinion held of them,&quot; spake
Fergus, &quot;but they are readily to be dealt with for such as
do know them. These are three battle-wheeled towers,&quot;
Fergus continued, &quot;as I perceive from their account.
Once I saw their like, namely when as prentice I accompanied
Dar&egrave; to Spain, so that we entered the service, of
the king of Spain, Esorb to wit, and we afterwards made
an expedition to Soda, that is, to the king of Africa, and
we gave battle to the Carthaginians. There came their like
upon us against the battle-line wherein we were, an hundred
battalions and three score hundred in each battalion. One
of the wheeled-towers won victory over us all, for we were
not on our guard against them. And this is the way to
defeat them: To mine a hole broader than the tower in
the ground in the front thereof and cover over the pitfall;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_342" name="Page_342" title="342">342</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5669.</span>
and for the battle-line to be drawn up over against it and
not to advance to attack, so that it is the towers that advance
and fall into the pit. Lebarcham told me, as I passed
over Taltiu, that the Ulstermen brought these towers from
Germany, and the towers held a third of the exiles of Ulster
among them as their only dwelling; and Cualgae ('a Heap
of Spears') is their name, namely battle-penfolds. And
herein have ye the sorest of all hardships, for although all
the men of Erin are drawn up against them, it is the men of
Erin that will be defeated. When they take it upon them
to engage in battle they cannot hold out without a combat.
Thus will they remain now till morning, every forty men
of them contending with the others. And this is my advice
to you,&quot; said Fergus: &quot;permit me with my division to
withstand them, and do ye betake yourselves to the woods
and wilds of Erin, and the Ulstermen shall not find ye in
any place, and I will proceed as an example, depending on
my own men-of-war.&quot; &quot;There are men here for ye!&quot;
cried Medb. &quot;That will be a force for yourselves,&quot; Fergus
made answer.<a name="footnotetag6_342" id="footnotetag6_342" href="#footnote6_342"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Yet another company came there to the same height
in Slane of Meath,&quot; said macRoth. &quot;Not fewer than a
division was in it; wild, dark-red, warrior-bands; <a name="footnotetag1_342" id="footnotetag1_342" href="#footnote1_342"><sup>1</sup></a>bright,
clear, blue-purple men;<a href="#footnote1_342"><sup>1</sup></a> long, fair-yellow heads of hair
they wore; handsome, shining countenances they had;
clear, kingly eyes; magnificent vesture with beautiful
mantles; conspicuous, golden brooches along their bright-coloured
sleeves; silken, glossy tunics; blue, glassy spears;
yellow shields for striking withal; gold-hilted, inlaid
swords set on their thighs; loud-tongued care has beset
them; sorrowful are they all, and mournful; sad are
the royal leaders; orphaned the brilliant company without

<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5689.</span>
their protecting lord who was wont to guard their
lands.&quot; &quot;But, who may they be?&quot; asked Ailill of Fergus.
&quot;Indeed, we know them well,&quot; Fergus made answer.
&quot;Furious lions are they; deeds of battle; the division from
the field of Murthemne are they. <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 100b.</span> It is this that makes
them cast-down, sorrowful, joyless <a name="footnotetag1_343" id="footnotetag1_343" href="#footnote1_343"><sup>1</sup></a>as they are,<a href="#footnote1_343"><sup>1</sup></a> because
that their own divisional king himself is not amongst them,
even Cuchulain, the restraining, victorious, red-sworded one
that triumpheth in battle!&quot; &quot;Good reason, in truth, there
is for them to be so,&quot; quoth Medb, &quot;if they are dejected,
mournful and joyless. There is no evil we have not worked
on them. We have harassed and we have assailed them,
<a name="footnotetag2_343" id="footnotetag2_343" href="#footnote2_343"><sup>2</sup></a>their territory and their land,<a href="#footnote2_343"><sup>2</sup></a> from Monday at the beginning
of Samaintide till the beginning of Spring.<a name="footnotetaga_343" id="footnotetaga_343" href="#footnotea_343"><sup>a</sup></a> We
have taken their women and their sons and their youths,
their steeds and their troops of horses, their herds and their
flocks and their droves. We have razed their hills after
them till they are become lowlands, so that they are level
with the plain. <a name="footnotetag3_343" id="footnotetag3_343" href="#footnote3_343"><sup>3</sup></a>We have brought their lords to bloody
stabs and sores, to cuts and many wounds.&quot;<a href="#footnote3_343"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;Not so, O
Medb!&quot; cried Fergus. &quot;There is naught thou canst boast
over them. For thou didst them no hurt nor harm that yon
fine company's leader avenged not on thee. For, every
mound and every grave, every stone and every tomb that
is from hence to the east of Erin is the mound and the grave,
the stone and the tomb of some goodly warrior and goodly
youth <a name="footnotetag4_343" id="footnotetag4_343" href="#footnote4_343"><sup>4</sup></a>of thy people,<a href="#footnote4_343"><sup>4</sup></a> fallen at the hands of the noble
chieftain of yonder company. Happy he to whom they
hold! Woe to him whom they oppose! It will be enough,
e'en as much as half a battle, for the men of Erin, when these
defend their lord in the battle on the morning of the
morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I heard a great uproar there, west of the battle or to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_344" name="Page_344" title="344">344</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5711.</span>
its east,&quot; said macRoth. &quot;Say, what noise was it?&quot;
asked Ailill of Fergus. &quot;Ah, but we know it well,&quot; Fergus
made answer: &quot;Cuchulain it was, straining to go, sick
as he is, to battle, wearied at the length of his lying sick on
Fert Sciach ('Thorn-mound') under hoops and clasps and
ropes, and the men of Ulster do not permit him to go because
of his sores and his wounds, inasmuch as he is not
fit for battle and is powerless for combat after his encounter
with Ferdiad.&quot;</p>

<p>True indeed spake Fergus. Cuchulain it was, wearied
at the length of his lying supine on Fert Sciach under hoops
and clasps and ropes. <a name="footnotetag1_344" id="footnotetag1_344" href="#footnote1_344"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;But, there is one thing more to
tell,&quot; said Fergus: &quot;unless he be held back now, he will
surely come to the battle!&quot;</p>

<p>Thus far the Companies of the T&aacute;in B&oacute; C&uacute;alnge<a href="#footnote1_344"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_344" id="footnotetag2_344" href="#footnote2_344"><sup>2</sup></a>mustered
by Conchobar and the men of Ulster.<a href="#footnote2_344"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Then came two women lampoonists from the camp and
quarters of the men of Erin; <a name="footnotetag3_344" id="footnotetag3_344" href="#footnote3_344"><sup>3</sup></a>their names,<a href="#footnote3_344"><sup>3</sup></a> Fethan and
Collach, to wit; and they stood with a feint of weeping
and wailing over Cuchulain, telling him of the defeat of
Ulster and the death of Conchobar and the fall of Fergus
in combat.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag4_344" id="footnotetag4_344" href="#footnote4_344"><sup>4</sup></a>Now Conchobar proceeded with his troops till he pitched
camp nearby his companions. Conchobar asked a truce of
Ailill till sunrise on the morrow, and Ailill granted it for the
men of Erin and the exiles, and Conchobar granted it for
the men of Ulster, and thereupon Conchobar's tents were
pitched. In this way the ground was bare between them,
and the Ulstermen came thither at sunset.<a href="#footnote4_344"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag1_346" id="footnotetag1_346" href="#footnote1_346"><sup>1</sup></a>Now Cuchulain was at Fedain Collna near by. Food
was brought to him that night by the purveyors, and they
were used to come to converse with him by day. He killed
not any of the men of Erin to the left of Ferdiad's Ford.<a href="#footnote1_346"><sup>1</sup></a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5756.</span> It was then that Cuchulain spake to Laeg son of Riangabair.
&quot;It would surely be unworthy of thee, O Laeg my master,&quot;
said Cuchulain, &quot;if between the two battle-lines there
should happen anything to-day whereof thou hadst no
tidings for me.&quot; &quot;Whatsoever I shall learn, O Cucucuc,&quot;
answered Laeg, &quot;will be told thee. But, see yonder a
little flock coming forth on the plain from the western camp
and station now. <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 101a.</span> Behold a band of henchmen after
them to check and to stay them. Behold also a company
of henchmen emerging from the eastern camp and station
to seize them.&quot; &quot;Surely, that is so!&quot; exclaimed Cuchulain.
&quot;That bodes a mighty combat and is the occasion
of a grand battle. The little flock will come over the plain
and the band of henchmen <a name="footnotetag2_346" id="footnotetag2_346" href="#footnote2_346"><sup>2</sup></a>from the east and the band
of henchmen from the west<a href="#footnote2_346"><sup>2</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag3_346" id="footnotetag3_346" href="#footnote3_346"><sup>3</sup></a>will encounter one another

battle.&quot;<a href="#footnote3_346"><sup>3</sup></a> There, indeed, Cuchulain spoke true. And the
little flock came forth upon the plain, and the companies of
henchmen met in fray. &quot;Who gives the battle now, O
Laeg my master,&quot; Cuchulain asked. &quot;The folk of Ulster,&quot;
Laeg answered: &quot;that is the same as the young warriors
<a name="footnotetag5_346" id="footnotetag5_346" href="#footnote5_346"><sup>5</sup></a>of Ulster.&quot;<a href="#footnote5_346"><sup>5</sup></a> &quot;But how fight they?&quot; Cuchulain asked.
&quot;Like men they fight,&quot; Laeg answered. &quot;There where
are the heroes of valour from the east in battle, they
force a breach through the ranks to the west. There where
are the heroes from the west, they lay a breach through
the ranks to the eastward.&quot; <a name="footnotetag6_346" id="footnotetag6_346" href="#footnote6_346"><sup>6</sup></a>&quot;It would be a vow for them
to fall in rescuing their herds,&quot; said Cuchulain; &quot;and

now?&quot; &quot;The beardless youths are fighting now,&quot; said
the charioteer. &quot;Has a bright cloud come over the sun
yet?&quot; Cuchulain asked. &quot;Nay, then,&quot; the charioteer
answered.<a name="footnotetag6_347" id="footnotetag6_347" href="#footnote6_346"><sup>6</sup></a> &quot;I grieve that I am not yet strong enough to
be on my feet amongst them. For, were I able to be on my
feet amongst them, my breach would be manifest there
to-day like that of another!&quot; &quot;But, this avow, O Cucuc,&quot;
said Laeg: &quot;it is no reproach to thy valour; it is no disgrace
to thine honour. Thou hast done bravely in time
before now and thou wilt do bravely hereafter.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag1_347" id="footnotetag1_347" href="#footnote1_347"><sup>1</sup></a>About the hour of sunrise: &quot;It is a haughty folk that

Thereupon arose all the men of Ulster at the one time in
the train of their king, and at the word of their prince, and to
prepare for the uprising in response to the call of Laeg son
of Riangabair. And in this wise they arose: stark-naked

<p>Not long was Laeg there when he witnessed something: the
men of Erin all arising at one time, taking their shields
and their spears and their swords and their helmets, and
urging the men-of-war before them to the battle. The
men of Erin, every single man of them, fell to smite and to
batter, to cut and to hew, to slay and to destroy the others

<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5859.</span>
for a long space and while. Thereupon Cuchulain asked
of his charioteer, of Laeg son of Riangabair, at the time
that a bright cloud came over the sun: <a name="footnotetag1_350" id="footnotetag1_350" href="#footnote1_350"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot;Look for us!<a href="#footnote1_350"><sup>1</sup></a>

Laeg?&quot; &quot;Like men they fight,&quot; Laeg answered. &quot;Should
I mount my chariot, and En, Conall <a name="footnotetag3_350" id="footnotetag3_350" href="#footnote3_350"><sup>3</sup></a>Cernach's ('the Victorious')<a href="#footnote3_350"><sup>3</sup></a>
charioteer, his chariot, and should we go in two
chariots from one wing to the other on the points of the
weapons, neither hoof nor wheel nor axle-tree nor chariot-pole
would touch <a name="footnotetag4_350" id="footnotetag4_350" href="#footnote4_350"><sup>4</sup></a>the ground<a href="#footnote4_350"><sup>4</sup></a> for the denseness and
closeness and firmness with which their arms are held in the
hands of the men-at-arms at this time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alas, that I am not yet strong enough to be amongst
them <a name="footnotetag5_350" id="footnotetag5_350" href="#footnote5_350"><sup>5</sup></a>now!&quot;<a href="#footnote5_350"><sup>5</sup></a> cried Cuchulain; &quot;for, were I able, my
breach would be manifest there to-day like that of another,&quot;
spake Cuchulain. &quot;But this avow, O Cucuc,&quot; said Laeg:
&quot;'tis no reproach to thy valour; 'tis no disgrace to thine
honour. Thou hast wrought great deeds before now and
thou wilt work great deeds hereafter.&quot;</p>

<p>Then began the men of Erin to smite and to batter, to
cut and to hew, to slay and to destroy the others for a long
space and while. Next came to them the nine chariot-fighters
of the champions from Norseland, and the three
foot-warriors along with them, and no swifter were the
nine chariot-men than the three men on foot.</p>

<p>Then said Medb to Fergus. &quot;It were truly a thing to
boast of for thee, <a name="footnotetag2_351" id="footnotetag2_351" href="#footnote2_351"><sup>2</sup></a>O Fergus,&quot; said she,<a href="#footnote2_351"><sup>2</sup></a> &quot;werest thou

<p>At that Ailill spoke to his own charioteer, Ferloga, to

gilla,&quot; said Ailill. <a name="footnotetag9_352" id="footnotetag9_352" href="#footnote9_352"><sup>9</sup></a>&quot;A year to-day I put that sword in

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_353" name="Page_353" title="353">353</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 5956.</span>
Ferloga went his way, and he brought the sword with
him in the flower of its safe-keeping, and fair flaming as
a candle. And the sword was placed in Ailill's hand, and
Ailill put it in Fergus' hand, and Fergus offered welcome
to the sword:<a name="footnotetaga_353" id="footnotetaga_353" href="#footnotea_353"><sup>a</sup></a> &quot;Welcome, O Calad Colg<a name="footnotetagb_353" id="footnotetagb_353" href="#footnoteb_353"><sup>b</sup></a> ('Hardblade'),

On whom shall I ply this weapon?&quot; Fergus asked. &quot;On
the men-of-war around thee,&quot; Medb answered. &quot;No one
shall find indulgence nor quarter from thee to-day, unless
some friend of thy bosom find it!&quot;</p>

<p>Whereupon, Fergus took his arms and went forward to
the battle, <a name="footnotetag1_353" id="footnotetag1_353" href="#footnote1_353"><sup>1</sup></a>and he cleared a gap of an hundred in the battle-ranks
with his sword in his two hands.<a href="#footnote1_353"><sup>1</sup></a> Ailill seized his
weapons. Medb seized her weapons and entered the battle.
<a name="footnotetag2_353" id="footnotetag2_353" href="#footnote2_353"><sup>2</sup></a>The Man&egrave; seized their arms and came to the battle. The
macMagach seized their arms and came to the battle,<a href="#footnote2_353"><sup>2</sup></a> so
that thrice the Ulstermen were routed before them from
the north, till Cualgae<a name="footnotetagc_353" id="footnotetagc_353" href="#footnotec_353"><sup>c</sup></a> and sword drove them back again.
<a name="footnotetag3_353" id="footnotetag3_353" href="#footnote3_353"><sup>3</sup></a>Or it was Cuchulain that drove the men of Erin before
him, so that he brought them back into their former line
in the battle.<a href="#footnote3_353"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Conchobar heard that from his place in the line of battle,
that the battle had gone against him thrice from the north.
Then he addressed his bodyguard, even the inner circle of
the Red Branch: &quot;Hold ye here a while, ye men!&quot; cried
he; &quot;even in the line <a name="footnotetag4_353" id="footnotetag4_353" href="#footnote4_353"><sup>4</sup></a>of battle<a href="#footnote4_353"><sup>4</sup></a> where I am, that I may
go and learn by whom the battle has been thus forced against
us thrice from the north.&quot; Then said his household: &quot;We
will hold out,&quot; said they, <a name="footnotetag5_353" id="footnotetag5_353" href="#footnote5_353"><sup>5</sup></a>&quot;in the place wherein we are:<a href="#footnote5_353"><sup>5</sup></a>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_354" name="Page_354" title="354">354</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5974.</span>
for the sky is above us and the earth underneath and the
sea round about us, <a name="footnotetag1_354" id="footnotetag1_354" href="#footnote1_354"><sup>1</sup></a>and<a href="#footnote1_354"><sup>1</sup></a> unless the heavens shall fall
with their showers of stars on the man-face of the world,
or unless the furrowed, blue-bordered ocean break o'er the
tufted brow of the earth, or unless the ground yawns open,
will we not move a thumb's breadth backward from here till
the very day of doom and of everlasting life, till thou come
back to us!&quot;</p>

<p>Conchobar went his way to the place where he heard the
battle had gone three times <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 102b.</span> against him from the north.
<a name="footnotetag2_354" id="footnotetag2_354" href="#footnote2_354"><sup>2</sup></a>Then Conchobar made a rush at Fergus,<a href="#footnote2_354"><sup>2</sup></a> and he lifted
shield against shield there, namely against Fergus mac
Roig, even Ochain ('the Fair-ear')<a name="footnotetaga_354" id="footnotetaga_354" href="#footnotea_354"><sup>a</sup></a> of Conchobar with
its four ears of gold and its four bracings of red gold. Therewith
Fergus gave three stout blows of Badb on the Ochain
of Conchobar, so that Conchobar's shield cried aloud on
him <a name="footnotetag3_354" id="footnotetag3_354" href="#footnote3_354"><sup>3</sup></a>and the three chief waves of Erin gave answer, the
Wave of Clidna, the Wave of Rudraige and the Wave of
Tuag, to wit.<a href="#footnote3_354"><sup>3</sup></a> Whenever Conchobar's shield cried out,
the shields of all the Ulstermen cried out. However great
the strength and power with which Fergus smote Conchobar
on the shield, so great also was the might and valour wherewith
Conchobar held the shield, so that the ear of the shield
did not even touch the ear of Conchobar.</p>

<p>&quot;Hearken, ye men <a name="footnotetag4_354" id="footnotetag4_354" href="#footnote4_354"><sup>4</sup></a>of Erin!&quot;<a href="#footnote4_354"><sup>4</sup></a> cried Fergus; &quot;who
opposes a shield to me to-day on this day of battle when
four of the five grand provinces of Erin come together on
Garech and Ilgarech in the battle of the Cattle-raid of
Cualnge?&quot; &quot;Why, then, a gilla that is younger and
mightier <a name="footnotetag5_354" id="footnotetag5_354" href="#footnote5_354"><sup>5</sup></a>and comelier<a href="#footnote5_354"><sup>5</sup></a> than thyself is here,&quot; <a name="footnotetag6_354" id="footnotetag6_354" href="#footnote6_354"><sup>6</sup></a>Conchobar

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_355" name="Page_355" title="355">355</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 5995.</span>
better! The man that hath driven thee out of thy borders,
thy land and thine inheritance; the man that hath driven
thee into the lairs of the deer and the wild hare and the foxes;
the man that hath not granted thee to take the breadth
<a name="footnotetag1_355" id="footnotetag1_355" href="#footnote1_355"><sup>1</sup></a>of thy foot<a href="#footnote1_355"><sup>1</sup></a> of thine own domain or land; the man that
hath made thee dependent upon the bounty of a woman;
the man that of a time disgraced thee by slaying the <a name="footnotetag2_355" id="footnotetag2_355" href="#footnote2_355"><sup>2</sup></a>three
bright lights of the valour of the Gael,<a href="#footnote2_355"><sup>2</sup></a> the three sons of
Usnech that were under thy safeguard <a name="footnotetag3_355" id="footnotetag3_355" href="#footnote3_355"><sup>3</sup></a>and protection;<a href="#footnote3_355"><sup>3</sup></a>
the man that will repel thee this day in the presence of the
men of Erin; Conchobar son of Fachtna Fathach son of
Ross Ruad son of Rudraige, High King of Ulster and son
of the High King of Erin; <a name="footnotetag4_355" id="footnotetag4_355" href="#footnote4_355"><sup>4</sup></a>and though any one should
insult thee, there is no satisfaction nor reparation for thee,
for thou art in the service of a woman!&quot;<a href="#footnote4_355"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Truly hath this happened to me.&quot; Fergus responded.
And Fergus placed his two hands on Calad Colg ('Hardblade'),
and he heaved a blow with it backwards behind
him, so that its point touched the ground, and he thought to
strike his three fateful blows of Badb on the men of Ulster,
so that their dead would be more in number than their
living. Cormac Conlongas son of Conchobar saw that
and he rushed to <a name="footnotetag5_355" id="footnotetag5_355" href="#footnote5_355"><sup>5</sup></a>his foster-father, namely to<a href="#footnote5_355"><sup>5</sup></a> Fergus,
and he closed his two <a name="footnotetag6_355" id="footnotetag6_355" href="#footnote6_355"><sup>6</sup></a>royal hands<a href="#footnote6_355"><sup>6</sup></a> over him <a name="footnotetag7_355" id="footnotetag7_355" href="#footnote7_355"><sup>7</sup></a>outside
his armour.<a href="#footnote7_355"><sup>7</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag8_355" id="footnotetag8_355" href="#footnote8_355"><sup>8</sup></a>&quot;Ungentle, not heedful is this, Fergus
my master! Full of hate, not of friendship is this,<a href="#footnote8_355"><sup>8</sup></a> O
Fergus my master! Let not the Ulstermen be slain and
destroyed by thee through thy destructive blows, but take
thou thought for their honour to-day on this day of battle!&quot;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_356" name="Page_356" title="356">356</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 6013.</span>
&quot;Get thee away from me, boy! <a name="footnotetag1_356" id="footnotetag1_356" href="#footnote1_356"><sup>1</sup></a>Whom then should I
strike?&quot;<a href="#footnote1_356"><sup>1</sup></a> exclaimed Fergus; &quot;for I will not remain alive
unless I deliver my three fateful strokes of Badb on the
men of Ulster this day, till their dead be more in number
than their living.&quot; &quot;Then turn thy hand slantwise,&quot; said
Cormac Conlongas, &quot;and slice off the hill-tops over the
heads of the hosts <a name="footnotetag2_356" id="footnotetag2_356" href="#footnote2_356"><sup>2</sup></a>on every side<a href="#footnote2_356"><sup>2</sup></a> and this will be an
appeasing of thine anger.&quot; &quot;Tell Conchobar also to fall
<a name="footnotetag3_356" id="footnotetag3_356" href="#footnote3_356"><sup>3</sup></a>back again<a href="#footnote3_356"><sup>3</sup></a> to his place in the battle,&quot; <a name="footnotetag4_356" id="footnotetag4_356" href="#footnote4_356"><sup>4</sup></a>said Fergus;
&quot;and I will no longer belabour the hosts.&quot;<a href="#footnote4_356"><sup>4</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag5_356" id="footnotetag5_356" href="#footnote5_356"><sup>5</sup></a>Cormac
told this to Conchobar:<a href="#footnote5_356"><sup>5</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag6_356" id="footnotetag6_356" href="#footnote6_356"><sup>6</sup></a>&quot;Go to the other side, O Conchobar,&quot;
said Cormac to his father, &quot;and this man will
not visit his anger any longer here on the men of Ulster.&quot;<a href="#footnote6_356"><sup>6</sup></a>
So Conchobar went to his place in the battle. <a name="footnotetag7_356" id="footnotetag7_356" href="#footnote7_356"><sup>7</sup></a>In this
manner Fergus and Conchobar parted.<a href="#footnote7_356"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag8_356" id="footnotetag8_356" href="#footnote8_356"><sup>8</sup></a>Fergus turned away. He slew a hundred warriors of
Ulster in the first onslaught with the sword. He met
Conall Cernach. &quot;Too great is this rage,&quot; said Conall,
&quot;upon people and kindred because of the whim of a wanton.&quot;
&quot;What would ye have me do, ye warriors?&quot; asked
Fergus. &quot;Smite the hills crosswise and the bushes around,&quot;
Conall Cernach made answer.<a href="#footnote8_356"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Thus it was with that sword, which was the sword of
Fergus: The sword of Fergus, the sword of Let&egrave; from
Faery: Whenever he desired to strike with it, it became
the size of a rainbow in the air. Thereupon Fergus turned
his hand slantwise over the heads of the hosts, so that he
smote the three tops of the three hills, so that they are still
on the moor in sight of <a name="footnotetag9_356" id="footnotetag9_356" href="#footnote9_356"><sup>9</sup></a>the men of Erin.<a href="#footnote9_356"><sup>9</sup></a> And these
are the three Maels ('the Balds') of Meath in that place,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_357" name="Page_357" title="357">357</a>
<a name="footnotetag1_357" id="footnotetag1_357" href="#footnote1_357"><sup>1</sup></a>which Fergus smote as a reproach and a rebuke to the
men of Ulster.<a href="#footnote1_357"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 6027.</span>
Now as regards Cuchulain. He heard the Ochain of
Conchobar smitten by Fergus macRoig. &quot;Come, O Laeg
my master,&quot; cried Cuchulain: &quot;who dares thus smite <a name="footnotetag2_357" id="footnotetag2_357" href="#footnote2_357"><sup>2</sup></a>with
those strong blows, mighty and far-away,<a href="#footnote2_357"><sup>2</sup></a> the Ochain of
Conchobar my master, and I alive?&quot; <a name="footnotetag3_357" id="footnotetag3_357" href="#footnote3_357"><sup>3</sup></a>Then Laeg made
answer, saying: &quot;The choice of men, Fergus macRoig,
the very bold, smites it:&mdash;<a href="#footnote3_357"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div>&quot;Blood he sheds&mdash;increase of slaughter&mdash;</div>
<div>Splendid the hero, Fergus macRoig!</div>
<div>Hidden had lain Fairyland's chariot-sword!</div>
<div>Battle now hath reached the shield,</div>
<div>Shield of my master Conchobar!&quot;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><a name="footnotetag4_357" id="footnotetag4_357" href="#footnote4_357"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;How far have the hosts advanced, O Laeg?&quot; Cuchulain
asked. &quot;They have come to Garech,&quot; Laeg answered.
&quot;I give my word for that,&quot; Cuchulain cried; &quot;they will
not come as far as Ilgarech, if I catch up with them! <a href="#footnote4_357"><sup>4</sup></a>Quickly
unloose the bands, gilla!&quot; cried Cuchulain. <a name="footnotetag5_357" id="footnotetag5_357" href="#footnote5_357"><sup>5</sup></a>&quot;Blood
covers men. Feats of swords shall be done. Men shall
be spent therefrom!&quot;<a href="#footnote5_357"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="footnotetag6_357" id="footnotetag6_357" href="#footnote6_357"><sup>6</sup></a>Since Cuchulain's going into battle had been prevented,
his twisting fit came upon him, and seven and twenty skin
tunics were given to him that used to be about him under
strings and cords when going into battle.<a href="#footnote6_357"><sup>6</sup></a> <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 103a.</span> Then Cuchulain
gave a mighty spring, so that the bindings of his wounds flew
from him to Mag Tuag ('the Plain of the Bows') in Connacht.
His bracings went from him to Bacca ('the Props') in Corcomruad
<a name="footnotetag7_357" id="footnotetag7_357" href="#footnote7_357"><sup>7</sup></a>in the district of Boirenn,<a href="#footnote7_357"><sup>7</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag8_357" id="footnotetag8_357" href="#footnote8_357"><sup>8</sup></a>His supports
sprang from him to <a name="footnotetag9_357" id="footnotetag9_357" href="#footnote9_357"><sup>9</sup></a>Rath<a href="#footnote9_357"><sup>9</sup></a> Cinn Bara ('the Rath of Spithead')
in Ulster, and likewise his pins flew from him to Rath
Clo ('the Rath of the Nails') in the land of the tribe of Conall.<a href="#footnote8_357"><sup>8</sup></a>
The dry wisps that were stuffed in his wounds rose to the roof
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_358" name="Page_358" title="358">358</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 6040.</span>
of the air and the sky as highest larks fly on a day of
sunshine when there is no wind. Thereupon, his bloody
wounds got the better of him, so that the ditches and furrows
of the earth were full of streams of blood and torrents of
gore.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag1_358" id="footnotetag1_358" href="#footnote1_358"><sup>1</sup></a>Some of the narrators aver that it was the strength of
the warrior and champion that hurled these things <a name="footnotetag2_358" id="footnotetag2_358" href="#footnote2_358"><sup>2</sup></a>to the
aforementioned places;<a href="#footnote2_358"><sup>2</sup></a> but it was not that, but his
powerful friends, the fairy-folk, that brought them thither,
to the end to make famous his history, so that from them
these places are named.<a href="#footnote1_358"><sup>1</sup></a>

This was the first exploit of valour that Cuchulain performed
on rising <a name="footnotetag3_358" id="footnotetag3_358" href="#footnote3_358"><sup>3</sup></a>out of his weakness:<a href="#footnote3_358"><sup>3</sup></a> The two women
lampoonists that made a feint of weeping and wailing <a name="footnotetag4_358" id="footnotetag4_358" href="#footnote4_358"><sup>4</sup></a>over
his head,<a href="#footnote4_358"><sup>4</sup></a> Fethan and Collach to wit, he smote each of them
against the head of the other, so that he<a name="footnotetaga_358" id="footnotetaga_358" href="#footnotea_358"><sup>a</sup></a> was red with
their blood and grey with their brains. <a name="footnotetag5_358" id="footnotetag5_358" href="#footnote5_358"><sup>5</sup></a>These women had
come from Medb to raise a pretended lamentation over him,
to the end that his bloody wounds might burst forth on him,
and to tell him that the men of Ulster had met with defeat
and that Fergus had fallen in meeting the battle.<a href="#footnote5_358"><sup>5</sup></a> His
arms had not been left near him, except his chariot only.
And he took his chariot on his back <a name="footnotetag6_358" id="footnotetag6_358" href="#footnote6_358"><sup>6</sup></a>with its frame and
its two axle-trees,<a href="#footnote6_358"><sup>6</sup></a> and he set out to attack the men of
Erin, and he smote them with the chariot, until he reached
the place where Fergus macRoig was. &quot;Turn hither,
O Fergus my master!&quot; he cried. Fergus did not answer,
for he heard not. He spoke again, &quot;Turn hither, <a name="footnotetag7_358" id="footnotetag7_358" href="#footnote7_358"><sup>7</sup></a>turn

Fergus. &quot;Who <a name="footnotetag3_359" id="footnotetag3_359" href="#footnote3_359"><sup>3</sup></a>of the men of Erin<a href="#footnote3_359"><sup>3</sup></a> dares to address
these stiff, vengeful words to me, where now the four grand
provinces of Erin are met on Garech and Ilgarech in the
battle of the Raid for the Kine of Cualnge?&quot; &quot;Thy
fosterling is before thee,&quot; he replied, &quot;and fosterling of
the men of Ulster and of Conchobar as well, Cuchulain son
of Sualtaim <a name="footnotetag4_359" id="footnotetag4_359" href="#footnote4_359"><sup>4</sup></a>and sister's son to Conchobar,&quot; replied Cuchalain.<a href="#footnote4_359"><sup>4</sup></a>
&quot;And thou didst promise to flee before me what
time I should be wounded, in pools of gore and riddled in
the battle of the T&aacute;in.<a name="footnotetaga_359" id="footnotetaga_359" href="#footnotea_359"><sup>a</sup></a> For, <a name="footnotetag5_359" id="footnotetag5_359" href="#footnote5_359"><sup>5</sup></a>when thou hadst not thy
sword with thee,<a href="#footnote5_359"><sup>5</sup></a> I did flee before thee in thine own combat
on the T&aacute;in; <a name="footnotetag6_359" id="footnotetag6_359" href="#footnote6_359"><sup>6</sup></a>and do thou avoid me,&quot; said he. &quot;Even
that did I promise,&quot; Fergus answered. &quot;Away with thee,
then!&quot; cried Cuchulain. &quot;'Tis well,&quot; replied Fergus;
&quot;thou didst avoid me; now thou art pierced with
wounds.&quot;<a href="#footnote6_359"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Fergus gave ear to that word of Cuchulain, and he turned
and made his three great strides of a hero <a name="footnotetag7_359" id="footnotetag7_359" href="#footnote7_359"><sup>7</sup></a>back from
Cuchulain and turned in flight from him.<a href="#footnote7_359"><sup>7</sup></a> And as he
turned <a name="footnotetag8_359" id="footnotetag8_359" href="#footnote8_359"><sup>8</sup></a>with his company of three thousand warriors and
the Leinstermen following after Fergus&mdash;for it is under
Fergus' warrant they had come<a href="#footnote8_359"><sup>8</sup></a>&mdash;<a name="footnotetag9_359" id="footnotetag9_359" href="#footnote9_359"><sup>9</sup></a>and the men of Munster,<a href="#footnote9_359"><sup>9</sup></a>
there turned all the men of Erin.</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_360" name="Page_360" title="360">360</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 6065.</span>
<a name="footnotetag1_360" id="footnotetag1_360" href="#footnote1_360"><sup>1</sup></a>Then<a href="#footnote1_360"><sup>1</sup></a> the men of Erin broke their ranks westwards
over the hill. The battle raged around the men of Connacht,
<a name="footnotetag2_360" id="footnotetag2_360" href="#footnote2_360"><sup>2</sup></a>around Ailill and his division and around Medb
with hers and around the Man&egrave; with theirs and the mac
Magach with theirs.<a href="#footnote2_360"><sup>2</sup></a> At midday Cuchulain came to the
battle. At the time of sunset at the ninth hour <a name="footnotetag3_360" id="footnotetag3_360" href="#footnote3_360"><sup>3</sup></a>as the
sun entered the tresses of the wood,<a href="#footnote3_360"><sup>3</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_360" id="footnotetag4_360" href="#footnote4_360"><sup>4</sup></a>when man and
tree were no more to be known apart, Medb and<a href="#footnote4_360"><sup>4</sup></a> the last
company of the men of Connacht fled in rout westwards
over the hill.</p>

<p>At that time there did not remain in Cuchulain's hand
of the chariot but a handful of its spokes around the wheel,
and a handbreadth of its poles around the shell, with the
slaying and slaughtering of the four grand provinces of
Erin during all that time.</p>

<p>Then Medb betook her to a shield-shelter in the rear of
the men of Erin. Thereafter Medb sent off the Brown
Bull of Cualnge along with fifty of his heifers and eight of
her runners with him around to Cruachan, to the end that
whoso might and whoso might not escape, the Brown Bull
of Cualnge should get away safely, even as she had promised.</p>

<p>Then it was that the issue of blood came upon Medb,
<a name="footnotetag5_360" id="footnotetag5_360" href="#footnote5_360"><sup>5</sup></a>and she said: &quot;Do thou, Fergus, undertake<a href="#footnote5_360"><sup>5</sup></a> a shield-shelter
in the rear of the men of Erin till I let my water flow
from me.&quot; &quot;By my troth,&quot; replied Fergus, &quot;'tis an ill
hour for thee to be taken so.&quot; &quot;Howbeit there is no help
for me,&quot; Medb answered; &quot;for I shall not live if I do
not void water!&quot; Fergus accordingly came and raised a
shield-shelter in the rear of the men of Erin. Medb voided
her water, so that it made three large dikes, so that a mill<a name="footnotetaga_360" id="footnotetaga_360" href="#footnotea_360"><sup>a</sup></a>
could find room in each dike. Hence the place is known
as Fual Medbha ('Medb's Water').</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_361" name="Page_361" title="361">361</a>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 6085.</span>
Cuchulain came upon her as she was thus engaged, <a name="footnotetag1_361" id="footnotetag1_361" href="#footnote1_361"><sup>1</sup></a>on
his way to the battle,<a href="#footnote1_361"><sup>1</sup></a> and he did not attack her. He
would not strike her a blow from behind. <a name="footnotetag2_361" id="footnotetag2_361" href="#footnote2_361"><sup>2</sup></a>He spared
her then because it was not his wont to slay women.<a href="#footnote2_361"><sup>2</sup></a>
<a name="footnotetag3_361" id="footnotetag3_361" href="#footnote3_361"><sup>3</sup></a>&quot;Spare me!&quot; cried Medb. &quot;If I should slay thee, it
were just for me,&quot; Cuchulain answered.<a href="#footnote3_361"><sup>3</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_361" id="footnotetag4_361" href="#footnote4_361"><sup>4</sup></a>&quot;Arise from
hence,&quot; said he; &quot;for I deem it no honour to wound thee
from behind with my weapons.&quot;<a href="#footnote4_361"><sup>4</sup></a> &quot;I crave a boon of
thee this day, O Cuchulain,&quot; spake Medb. &quot;What boon
cravest thou <a name="footnotetag5_361" id="footnotetag5_361" href="#footnote5_361"><sup>5</sup></a>of me?&quot;<a href="#footnote5_361"><sup>5</sup></a> asked Cuchulain. &quot;That this
host be under thine honour and thy protection till they
pass westwards over Ath Mor ('the Great Ford').&quot; <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 103b.</span>
&quot;Yea, I promise that,&quot; said Cuchulain. <a name="footnotetag6_361" id="footnotetag6_361" href="#footnote6_361"><sup>6</sup></a>Then<a href="#footnote6_361"><sup>6</sup></a> went
Cuchulain around the men of Erin, and he undertook a
shield-defence on one side of them, in order to protect the
men of Erin. On the other side went the governors of
the men of Erin. Medb went to her own place and assumed
a shield-defence in the rear of the men of Erin, and in
this manner they convoyed the men of Erin over Ath Mor
westwards.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag7_361" id="footnotetag7_361" href="#footnote7_361"><sup>7</sup></a>Then Laeg <a name="footnotetag8_361" id="footnotetag8_361" href="#footnote8_361"><sup>8</sup></a>son of Riangabair<a href="#footnote8_361"><sup>8</sup></a> brought Cuchulain's
sword unto him, <a name="footnotetag9_361" id="footnotetag9_361" href="#footnote9_361"><sup>9</sup></a>the 'Hard-headed Steeling' to wit,<a href="#footnote9_361"><sup>9</sup></a> and
Cuchulain took the sword in his hand.<a href="#footnote7_361"><sup>7</sup></a> Then he <a name="footnotetag10_361" id="footnotetag10_361" href="#footnote10_361"><sup>10</sup></a>stood
still and<a href="#footnote10_361"><sup>10</sup></a> gave a blow to the three bald-topped hills of Ath
Luain over against the three Maela ('the Bald Tops') of
Meath, so that he struck their three heads off them. <a name="footnotetag11_361" id="footnotetag11_361" href="#footnote11_361"><sup>11</sup></a>And
they are in the bog as a witness ever since. Hence these are
the Maolain ('the Flat Tops') of Ath Luain. Cuchulain cut
them off as a reproach and affront to the men of Connacht,
in order that every time men should speak of Meath's
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_362" name="Page_362" title="362">362</a>
three Bald Tops, these in the west should be the answer
the 'Three Flat Tops of Ath Luain.'<a name="footnotetag11_362" id="footnotetag11_362" href="#footnote11_361"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 6099.</span>
Then <a name="footnotetag1_362" id="footnotetag1_362" href="#footnote1_362"><sup>1</sup></a>when the battle had been lost,<a href="#footnote1_362"><sup>1</sup></a> Fergus <a name="footnotetag2_362" id="footnotetag2_362" href="#footnote2_362"><sup>2</sup></a>began to
view<a href="#footnote2_362"><sup>2</sup></a> the host as it went westwards of Ath Mor. &quot;It was
thus indeed it behoved this day to prove, for following in the
lead of a woman,&quot; <a name="footnotetag3_362" id="footnotetag3_362" href="#footnote3_362"><sup>3</sup></a>said Fergus.<a href="#footnote3_362"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;Faults and feuds

and sold is this host to-day,&quot; <a name="footnotetag5_362" id="footnotetag5_362" href="#footnote5_362"><sup>5</sup></a>Fergus answered.<a href="#footnote5_362"><sup>5</sup></a>
&quot;And even as a brood-mare leads her foals into a land unknown,
without a head to advise or give counsel before them,
such is the plight of this host to-day <a name="footnotetag6_362" id="footnotetag6_362" href="#footnote6_362"><sup>6</sup></a>in the train of a

<h2>XXVIII. <a name="footnotetag1_363" id="footnotetag1_363" href="#footnote1_363"><sup>1</sup></a>THE BATTLE OF THE BULLS<a href="#footnote1_363"><sup>1</sup></a></h2>


<p><span class="sidenoteL">W. 6121.</span>
As regards Medb, it is related here: <a name="footnotetag2_363" id="footnotetag2_363" href="#footnote2_363"><sup>2</sup></a>She suffered not the
hosts to disperse forthwith,<a href="#footnote2_363"><sup>2</sup></a> but she gathered the men of
Erin and led them forth to Cruachan to behold the battle
of the bulls <a name="footnotetag3_363" id="footnotetag3_363" href="#footnote3_363"><sup>3</sup></a>and in what manner they would part from
one another. For during the while the battle was being
fought, the Brown Bull of Cualnge with fifty heifers in his
company had been brought to Cruachan.<a href="#footnote3_363"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>As regards the Brown Bull of Cualnge, it is now recounted
in this place: When he saw the beautiful, strange land, he
sent forth his three bellowing calls aloud. And Finnbennach
Ai ('the Whitehorned of Ai') heard him. Now no
male beast durst <a name="footnotetag4_363" id="footnotetag4_363" href="#footnote4_363"><sup>4</sup></a>send forth<a href="#footnote4_363"><sup>4</sup></a> a low that was louder
than a moo in compare with him within the four fords of
all Ai, Ath Moga and Ath Coltna, Ath Slissen and Ath
Bercha. And <a name="footnotetag5_363" id="footnotetag5_363" href="#footnote5_363"><sup>5</sup></a>the Whitehorned<a href="#footnote5_363"><sup>5</sup></a> lifted his head with
fierce anger <a name="footnotetag6_363" id="footnotetag6_363" href="#footnote6_363"><sup>6</sup></a>at the bellowing of the Brown of Cualnge,<a href="#footnote6_363"><sup>6</sup></a>
and he hastened to Cruachan to look for the Brown Bull of
Cualnge.</p>

<p>It was then the men of Erin debated who would be
<a name="footnotetag7_363" id="footnotetag7_363" href="#footnote7_363"><sup>7</sup></a>fitted<a href="#footnote7_363"><sup>7</sup></a> to witness <a name="footnotetag8_363" id="footnotetag8_363" href="#footnote8_363"><sup>8</sup></a>the fight<a href="#footnote8_363"><sup>8</sup></a> of the bulls. They all agreed
that it should be Bricriu son of Carbad <a name="footnotetag9_363" id="footnotetag9_363" href="#footnote9_363"><sup>9</sup></a>that were fitted
for that office.<a href="#footnote9_363"><sup>9</sup></a> For, a year before this tale of the Cualnge
Cattle-raid, Bricriu had gone from the one province into the
other to make a request of Fergus. And Fergus had retained
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_364" name="Page_364" title="364">364</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 6134.</span>
him with him waiting for his treasures and goods. And
a quarrel arose between him and Fergus at a game of chess.<a name="footnotetaga_364" id="footnotetaga_364" href="#footnotea_364"><sup>a</sup></a>
And he spake evil words to Fergus. Fergus smote him
with his fist and with the chess-man that was in his hand,
so that he drave the chess-man into his head and broke a
bone in his head. Whilst the men of Erin were on the foray
of the T&aacute;in, all that time Bricriu was being cured at
Cruachan. And the day they returned from the expedition
was the day Bricriu rose. <a name="footnotetag1_364" id="footnotetag1_364" href="#footnote1_364"><sup>1</sup></a>He came with the rest to witness
the battle of the bulls.<a href="#footnote1_364"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag2_364" id="footnotetag2_364" href="#footnote2_364"><sup>2</sup></a>And this is why they selected
Bricriu,<a href="#footnote2_364"><sup>2</sup></a> for that Bricriu was no fairer to his friend than to
his foe. <a name="footnotetag3_364" id="footnotetag3_364" href="#footnote3_364"><sup>3</sup></a>&quot;Come, ye men of Erin!&quot; cried Bricriu; &quot;permit
me to judge the fight of the bulls,<a href="#footnote3_364"><sup>3</sup></a> <a name="footnotetag4_364" id="footnotetag4_364" href="#footnote4_364"><sup>4</sup></a>for it is I shall most
truly recount their tale and their deeds afterwards.&quot;<a href="#footnote4_364"><sup>4</sup></a>
And he was brought <a name="footnotetag5_364" id="footnotetag5_364" href="#footnote5_364"><sup>5</sup></a>before the men of Erin<a href="#footnote5_364"><sup>5</sup></a> to a gap
whence to view the bulls.</p>

<p><a name="footnotetag6_364" id="footnotetag6_364" href="#footnote6_364"><sup>6</sup></a>So they drove the Brown Bull the morning of the fight
till he met the Whitehorned at Tarbga in the plain of Ai:
or Tarbguba ('Bull-groan'), or Tarbgleo ('Bull-fight'); Roi
Dedond was the first name of that hill. Every one that
had lived through the battle cared for naught else than to
see the combat of the two bulls.<a href="#footnote6_364"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Each of the bulls sighted the other and there was a pawing
and digging up of the ground in their frenzy there, and
they tossed the earth over them. They threw up the earth
over their withers and shoulders, and their eyes blazed
red <sup>*</sup><span class="sidenoteR">LL. fo. 104a.</span> in their heads like firm balls of fire, <a name="footnotetag7_364" id="footnotetag7_364" href="#footnote7_364"><sup>7</sup></a>and their sides
bent like mighty boars on a hill.<a href="#footnote7_364"><sup>7</sup></a> Their cheeks and their
nostrils swelled like smith's bellows in a forge. And each
of them gave a resounding, deadly blow to the other. Each
of them began to hole and to gore, to endeavour to slaughter
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_365" name="Page_365" title="365">365</a>
<span class="sidenoteL">W. 6151.</span>
and demolish the other. Then the Whitehorned of Ai
visited his wrath upon the Brown Bull of Cualnge for the
evil of his ways and his doings, and he drave a horn into his
side and visited his angry rage upon him. Then they
directed their headlong course to where Bricriu was, so that
the hoofs of the bulls drove him a man's cubit deep into the
ground after his destruction. Hence, this is the Tragical
Death of Bricriu <a name="footnotetag1_365" id="footnotetag1_365" href="#footnote1_365"><sup>1</sup></a>son of Carbad.<a href="#footnote1_365"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Cormac Conlongas son of Conchobar saw that, <a name="footnotetag2_365" id="footnotetag2_365" href="#footnote2_365"><sup>2</sup></a>and
the force of affection arose in him,<a href="#footnote2_365"><sup>2</sup></a> and he laid hold of a
spearshaft that filled his grasp, and gave three blows to
the Brown Bull of Cualnge from ear to tail, <a name="footnotetag3_365" id="footnotetag3_365" href="#footnote3_365"><sup>3</sup></a>so that it
broke on his thick hide from ear to rump.<a href="#footnote3_365"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;No wonderful,
lasting treasure was this precious prize for us,&quot; said Cormac,
&quot;that cannot defend himself against a stirk of his own
age!&quot; The Brown Bull of Cualnge heard this&mdash;for he had
human understanding<a name="footnotetaga_365" id="footnotetaga_365" href="#footnotea_365"><sup>a</sup></a>&mdash;and he turned upon the Whitehorned.
<a name="footnotetag4_365" id="footnotetag4_365" href="#footnote4_365"><sup>4</sup></a>Thereupon the Brown of Cualnge became infuriated,
and he described a very circle of rage around the
Whitehorned, and he rushed at him, so that he broke his
lower leg with the shock.<a href="#footnote4_365"><sup>4</sup></a> And thereafter they continued
to strike at each other for a long while and great space of
time, <a name="footnotetag5_365" id="footnotetag5_365" href="#footnote5_365"><sup>5</sup></a>and so long as the day lasted they watched the
contest of the bulls<a href="#footnote5_365"><sup>5</sup></a> till night fell on the men of Erin. And
when night had fallen, all that the men of Erin could hear
was the bellowing and roaring. That night the bulls
coursed over <a name="footnotetag6_365" id="footnotetag6_365" href="#footnote6_365"><sup>6</sup></a>the greater part of<a href="#footnote6_365"><sup>6</sup></a> all Erin. <a name="footnotetag7_365" id="footnotetag7_365" href="#footnote7_365"><sup>7</sup></a>For every
spot in Erin wherein is a 'Bulls' Ditch,' or a 'Bulls' Gap,'
or a 'Bulls' Fen,' or a 'Bulls' Loch,' or a 'Bulls' Rath,'

saw coming over Cruachan from the west the Brown Bull

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
